A plan view is a horizontal display of 2D data  on the map, or a horizontal 
  cross-section of 3D data. Conventional contour plots of data on a
  map are a plan view.

<p>

Plan views can be displayed in several
   ways:
   <ul>
   <li>with solid or dashed contour lines	 
     <li>with contour lines colored by value
     <li>with color-filled contours
     <li>with "color-shaded"   
     images (all data grid cells colored by value, which may be smoothed)
   </ul>
<br>

Colors help
distinguish values and subtle features, and if used carefully 
can be an intuitive indication of
value and  trend, such as using "hot" colors for higher or important values.

<p>

An IDV 3D Plan View can be set to any level of the data levels in the
data source, or between
  data levels, in which case interpolation is used to estimate the
  data values in the plan view. A colored square selector point
  in the left corner of the 3D plan view 
  can be moved up and down by dragging the  mouse button
  to re-position the level.
You can make several 3D plan views at the same time, for one
or more parameters in 3D data.
