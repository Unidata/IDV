<div class="pagetitle">Overview</div>

<p>Unidata's Integrated Data Viewer (IDV) is a Java&#153;-based software
framework for analyzing and visualizing geoscience data. The IDV release
includes a library and a reference application made from that software.
It is based on [ht::popup "http://www.ssec.wisc.edu/~billh/visad.html" VisAD] 
(http://www.ssec.wisc.edu/~billh/visad.html), an open-source,
Java library for building interactive and collaborative visualization
and analysis tools, as well as other Java-based utility packages.</p>

<p>The IDV is being developed at the Unidata Program Center (UPC),
part of the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research,
Boulder, Colorado, under funding provided by the National Science
Foundation. The software is freely available under the terms of the
[ht::popup "http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/lesser.html"  "GNU Lesser General
Public License"]. </p>

<p>The IDV brings together the ability to display and work with satellite
imagery, gridded data (for example, numerical weather prediction model
output), surface observations (METARs), upper air soundings, NWS NEXRAD
Level II and Level III RADAR data, NOAA National Profiler Network
data and GIS data, all within a unified interface. The IDV "reference
application" provides many of the standard 2-D data displays that other
Unidata packages (e.g. GEMPAK and McIDAS) provide. It also provides
3-D views of the atmosphere and allows users to interactively slice,
dice, and probe the data, creating cross-sections, profiles, animations
and value read-outs of multi-dimensional data sets. Computations and
displays of built-in and user-supplied formula-based derived quantities
are supported. A feature unique to the IDV is an integrated HTML
display that can be used to create HTML-based users' interfaces to
drive the displays. You can also embed fully-interactive 2D and 3D
IDV displays in HTML documents, when viewed with the IDV. The 
[ht::popup "%urlroot%/docs/userguide " "IDV User's Guide"] 
describes the IDV reference application.

The IDV software library can be easily be used and extended to create
custom geoscience applications beyond the atmospheric science realm.
This customization allows new applications to be tailored
to specific datasets and provide customized user interfaces for different
tasks. One example of a specialized IDV application is the
