This ZIP file contains a set of Java Archive (JAR) files
that are required to run the Integrated Data Viewer (IDV)
programs. It should contain the following files:

    idv.jar               - the IDV classes
    auxdata.jar           - supporting data files (maps, icons)
    external.jar          - external packages (e.g. JDOM, JAI, IJ, JH, JMF, etc)
    jython.jar            - Jython
    local-visad.jar       - UPC mods to VisAD not yet in visad.jar
    visad.jar             - VisAD
    ncIdv.jar             - netcdf-Java 4.0 library

There is also an example JNLP file (localjars.jnlp) which allows
you to stage the JARS above as a WebStart distribution.  To use
this:

1) Unpack all the JARs into a directory under your web server.  

2) Edit (and alternatively rename) the localjars.jnlp file and 
   change the path for your local server. If you will be running
   this on machines with 512 Mb or more, you can bump up the 
   max-heap-size parameter to "384m" or "512m" for better performance:

         <j2se version="1.5" max-heap-size="512m" /> 

3) Configure your Web server so that all files with the .jnlp file 
   extension are set to the application/x-java-jnlp-file MIME type.
   Each Web server has a specific way in which to add MIME types. For 
   example, for the Apache Web server you must add the following line 
   to the .mime.types configuration file:

   application/x-java-jnlp-file JNLP

   Check the documentation for the specifics of your Web server.

4) Create a web page with a link to the JNLP file and users should 
   be able to launch the IDV using that link.

5) This does not include Java and Java 3D so each client will have
to have that installed locally.
