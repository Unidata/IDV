[ht::head {Derived Data and Formulas}]

The IDV uses the Formula infrastructure to also automatically create derived
products from loaded data sources.  These derived products show up
in the list of Fields under a "Derived" tab.

<ol class="step">
<li>Let's look at the Horizontal Advection formula</li>
  <ul class="substep">
    <li>From the [ht::menu Edit Formulas {Edit Formulas} System]
        menu, select the
        [ht::param {Horizontal Advection (from %N1% &amp; %N2%)}] 
        item.</li>
    <li>The formula looks like:
        <pre>
        DerivedGridFactory.createHorizontalAdvection\(scalar_parameter, D1\[label=U Component\], D2\[label=V Component\]\)
        </pre>
        The [ht::param D1 and D2] fields can be automatically bound to 
        specific parameters and 
        [ht::param scalar_parameter] is a field that the user 
        will be prompted for.
     <li>In the [ht::command Description], the [ht::param {%N1% and %N2%}]
         fields correspond to the names of the bound parameters in the
         order listed in the formula (not the number after the <b>D</b>]
     <li>Select the [ht::tab Derived] tab.
     <li>This formula is used as both an end user formula and  as a way
         to automatically create derived quantities.  It uses predefined
         parameter group called [ht::param u_and_v] to find variables in
         a dataset that can be used to fill in for the 
         [ht::param D1 and D2] parameters.  
     <li>Click the [ht::button Cancel] button to close the window.
     <li>Select the [ht::datasource Formulas] Data Source.
     <li>Select the 
        [ht::param {System-&gt;Horizontal Advection (from %N1% &amp; %N2%)}] 
        field, select [ht::display {Contour Plan View}] display and
        click [ht::button Create Display].  Notice how the formula
        relates to the dialog that pops up.</li>
     <li>Click the [ht::button Cancel] button to close the window.
     </ul>

<li>Display Temperature Advection from the derived formula list</li>
  <ul class="substep">
    <li>[ht::loadEtaGrid]
    <li>Expand the [ht::menu {3D grid} {Derived}] tab in the 
        [ht::command Fields] panel of the [ht::command Field Selector]
        and select the 
        [ht::param {Horizontal Advection (from GridRelative_u &amp; GridRelative_v)}]
        field.  Hold the mouse over the label to look at the
        tooltip which shows the formula for this field.  Notice that
        the [ht::param {%N1% and %N2%}] parameters in the formula description
        have been filled in.

    <li>Select the [ht::display {Contour Plan View}] display and
        click [ht::button {Create Display}].

    <li>When prompted for the [ht::param scalar parameter], select
        the [ht::param {3D  grid-&gt;temperature}] field and click
        [ht::button OK].
   </ul>
</li>
<li>Now, let's create a system formula for Temperature advection that will
show up when a grid is loaded.</li>
  <ul class="substep">
    <li>Select the [ht::datasource Formulas] Data Source.
    <li>Right click on the 
        [ht::param {System-&gt;Horizontal Advection (from %N1% &amp; %N2%)}] 
        field and select  [ht::menu {Copy Formula}].
    <ul class="substep">
        <li>Change the [ht::command Name] to [ht::param tadv].
        <li>Change the [ht::command Formula] to 
        [ht::param {DerivedGridFactory.createHorizontalAdvection(D1, D2, D3)}].
        <li>Change the [ht::command Description] to 
        [ht::param {Temperature Advection (from %N1%, %N2% &amp; %N3%)}].
        <li>Change the [ht::command Group] to 
           [ht::param {Custom Derived}].
        <li>Select the [ht::command Derived] tab.  
        <li>Clear out the [ht::param u_and_v] under Parameter Groups.
        <li> Look at the list of available groups. We could use the group created in the prior exercise using the [ht::dialog Parameter Groups Editor] but for now we will enter the parameter names to match on directly.
        <li>In the [ht::command Parameters] input area, right click and
            select the Temperature, U component and V components
            (one at a time) from the [ht::menu Aliases {Group #1}]
            menu available from the <img src="images/DownDown.gif"> button 
	    or type [ht::param TEMP,U,V].
        <li>Click the [ht::button Change Formula] button.  The 
            [ht::datasource Formulas] data source now has a
            [ht::param My Derived] category in the 
            [ht::command Fields] panel.
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Right click on the [ht::datasource NCEP Model Data] data source
        and select [ht::menu Reload Data] to refresh the list of 
        parameters.  Derived data selections are only created when
        the Data Source is loaded or reloaded.</li>
    <li>Select the [ht::param {My Derived-&gt;Temperature Advection (from T, GridRelative_u &amp; GridRelative_v)}] parameter and the  
        [ht::display {Contour Plan View}] display and then click
        the [ht::button Create Display] button.</li>
    <li>Compare the two displays.
    <li>Remove the displays, but not the data.
    <li>From the [ht::datasource Formulas] data source, right click
        on the 
        [ht::param {My Derived-&gt;Temperature Advection (from %N1%, %N2% &amp; %N3%)}]
        field and select [ht::menu Edit Formula].</li>
    <li>Remove the [ht::command Group] for the formula  and click
        [ht::button  Change Formula].
    <li>Reload the [ht::datasource  NCEP Model Data ETA] datasource.
    <li>Where did the derived formula go this time?
    <li>Use the [ht::chooser Files] chooser to load in the 
        [ht::filename sample_eta_grid.nc] file.
    <li>Does this have a temperature advection field?
  </ul>
</li>


<li>Let's just look at the [ht::filename derived.xml] file in:<p>
<i><%workshop.homedir%>/.unidata/idv/DefaultIdv</i><p>

to see what the formula looks like.
