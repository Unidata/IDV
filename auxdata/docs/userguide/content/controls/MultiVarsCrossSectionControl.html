{More with Vertical Cross-section Control}


{
The newly developed feature will allow to add two more cross-section displays to
the original cross-section display:

The second shows the settings for this display control:

After creating the first vertical cross-sections display, you can add a contour cross-section
display for a second variable as well as a wind vector cross-section display for a derived variable.
When working multi variables cross-section displays, we recommend using a color-filled contour display
or a color-shaded display, and contour displays for the second or the third variables.



You can add new parameters a number of ways:
<ul>
    <li> Through the  [ug::menu Edit {Add Parameter...}] menu.
    <li> Through the  [ug::menu View Parameters {Add Parameter...}] menu.
</ul>

The design only allows maximum three cross-section displays. The newly added parameter has a remove
action that can be applied:

<ul>
    <li> [ug::menu {Remove}]. Remove the selected parameter.
</ul>

{{Newly added Parameter} {In the display control, checkboxes with parameter name are a modal dialogs
and have all control widgets associated with newly added parameters.}}
