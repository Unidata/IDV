The Point Cloud control displays point data as a set of colored points.  It is more efficient than the Point Data Plot control for showing
the locations of a large number (e.g. millions) of points.  It does not do automatic spatial decluttering, but you can subset by data value
and drawing a clip region. The control window contains three tabs. The first shows the point cloud control

The second shows the clipping control, it is a simplify version of draw control

{{Point Size}  {
You can change the size of the displayed points with the Point Size widget. Enter a point size and hit return.
}}

clipping boundary. The clipping boundary is set by using the drawing items in the Clipping tab.
