<%nochildlist%>

You can load maps (shapefiles) into the Map Display of the IDV and then write out
a plugin that contains the maps so other can easily use your maps.
<p>

<h3>Prepare your map files</h3>
<ol>
<li>
You first need to prepare your map files.
ESRI Shapefiles often have 3 or 4 separate files, e.g.:<pre>
map1.shp
map1.dbf
map1.prj
...
map2.shp
map2.dbf
map2.prj
</pre>


You will need to zip up each set:<pre>
zip map1.zip map1.shp map1.dbf map1.prj
zip map2.zip map2.shp map2.dbf map2.prj
</pre>

<li>
Now, in the <a href="controls/MapDisplayControl.html">Map Display</a>
go to the Edit menu and select [ht::menu {Add your own maps}].
In the dialog select your map file from disk, give it a name, category and
initial properties and load it in. Repeat these steps for your other map files.


<li> Note: Some maps just have points. Currently when displaying such maps
nothing is shown. 

</ol>

<h3>Save maps as a plugin</h3>

The Map Display control can add these maps to the <a href="PluginCreator.html">Plugin Creator</a>.
<ol>
<li> Turn on the visbility of the maps you would like to save.
<li> Turn off the visibility of the maps you do not want to include.
<li> From the File menu in the Map Display Control window select
[ht::menu Save {Export to Plugin}]
<li> In the Dialog box just press OK
<li>  This adds your selection and the map description file to
the Plugin Creator.
Consult the <a href="PluginCreator.html">Plugin Creator</a> documentation for writing out
the file.
</ol>


Now, you can add the new map plugin through the
<a href="Plugins.html">Plugin Manager</a> and/or give this plugin to your colleagues
for their use.
