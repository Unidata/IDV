 * <p/>
 * Conversion is NOT FULLY TESTED.
 * <p/>
 * USAGE:      diff oldfile newfile
 * <p/>
 * This program assumes that "oldfile" and "newfile" are text files.
 * The program writes to stdout a description of the changes which would
 * transform "oldfile" into "newfile".
 * <p/>
 * The printout is in the form of commands, each followed by a block of
 * text. The text is delimited by the commands, which are:
 * <p/>
 * DELETE AT n
 * ..deleted lines
 * <p/>
 * INSERT BEFORE n
 * ..inserted lines
 * <p/>
 * n MOVED TO BEFORE n
 * ..moved lines
 * <p/>
 * n CHANGED FROM
 * ..old lines
 * CHANGED TO
 * ..newer lines
 * <p/>
 * The line numbers all refer to the lines of the oldfile, as they are
 * numbered before any commands are applied.
 * The text lines are printed as-is, without indentation or prefixing. The
 * commands are printed in upper case, with a prefix of ">>>>", so that
 * they will stand out. Other schemes may be preferred.
 * Files which contain more than MAXLINECOUNT lines cannot be processed.
 * This can be fixed by changing "symbol" to a Vector.
 * The algorithm is taken from Communications of the ACM, Apr78 (21, 4, 264-),
 * "A Technique for Isolating Differences Between Files."
 * Ignoring I/O, and ignoring the symbol table, it should take O(N) time.
 * This implementation takes fixed space, plus O(U) space for the symbol
 * table (where U is the number of unique lines). Methods exist to change
 * the fixed space to O(N) space.
 * Note that this is not the only interesting file-difference algorithm. In
 * general, different algorithms draw different conclusions about the
 * changes that have been made to the oldfile. This algorithm is sometimes
 * "more right", particularly since it does not consider a block move to be
 * an insertion and a (separate) deletion. However, on some files it will be
 * "less right". This is a consequence of the fact that files may contain
 * many identical lines (particularly if they are program source). Each
 * algorithm resolves the ambiguity in its own way, and the resolution
 * is never guaranteed to be "right". However, it is often excellent.
 * This program is intended to be pedagogic.  Specifically, this program was
 * the basis of the Literate Programming column which appeared in the
 * Communications of the ACM (CACM), in the June 1989 issue (32, 6,
 * 740-755).
 * By "pedagogic", I do not mean that the program is gracefully worded, or
 * that it showcases language features or its algorithm. I also do not mean
 * that it is highly accessible to beginners, or that it is intended to be
 * read in full, or in a particular order. Rather, this program is an
 * example of one professional's style of keeping things organized and
 * maintainable.
 * The program would be better if the "print" variables were wrapped into
 * a struct. In general, grouping related variables in this way improves
 * documentation, and adds the ability to pass the group in argument lists.
 * This program is a de-engineered version of a program which uses less
 * memory and less time.  The article points out that the "symbol" arrays
 * can be implemented as arrays of pointers to arrays, with dynamic
 * allocation of the subarrays.  (In C, macros are very useful for hiding
 * the two-level accesses.) In Java, a Vector would be used. This allows an
 * extremely large value for MAXLINECOUNT, without dedicating fixed arrays.
 * (The "other" array can be allocated after the input phase, when the exact
 * sizes are known.) The only slow piece of code is the "strcmp" in the tree
 * descent: it can be speeded up by keeping a hash in the tree node, and
 * only using "strcmp" when two hashes happen to be equal.
 * <p/>
 * Change Log
 * ----------
 * 1Jan97 Ian F. Darwin: first working rewrite in Java, based entirely on
 * D.C.Lindsay's reasonable C version.
 * Changed comments from /***************** to /**, shortened, added
 * whitespace, used tabs more, etc.
 * 6jul89 D.C.Lindsay, CMU: fixed portability bug. Thanks, Gregg Wonderly.
 * Just changed "char ch" to "int ch".
 * Also added comment about way to improve code.
 * 10jun89 D.C.Lindsay, CMU: posted version created.
 * Copyright notice changed to ACM style, and Dept. is now School.
 * ACM article referenced in docn.
 * 26sep87 D.C.Lindsay, CMU: publication version created.
 * Condensed all 1982/83 change log entries.
 * Removed all command line options, and supporting code. This
 * simplified the input code (no case reduction etc). It also
 * simplified the symbol table, which was capable of remembering
 * offsets into files (instead of strings), and trusting (!) hash
 * values to be unique.
 * Removed dynamic allocation of arrays: now fixed static arrays.
 * Removed speed optimizations in symtab package.
 * Removed string compression/decompression code.
 * Recoded to Unix standards from old Lattice/MSDOS standards.
 * (This affected only the #include's and the IO.)
 * Some renaming of variables, and rewording of comments.
 * 1982/83 D.C.Lindsay, Symbionics: created.
