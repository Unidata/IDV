<div class="overview">
Each display has a <b>display control</b> associated with it.  
A [ht::dialog {Display Control Window}] is a panel or window
with menus, buttons, sliders, and other widgets to control a display.
When a display is first created its <b>display control</b> is added 
to the [ht::dialog Dashboard] or pops up in a separate window depending
on your configuration.  The control also has a legend shown in the 
[ht::display View Window]'s legend panel.
</div>

<div class="pagesubtitle">The Display Control Window</div>

The control window is used to change the properties of the display.
Each display type may have a different set of widgets in the
control window.  For our dewpoint display, the control looks
like this:

[ht::cimg images/DisplayControlWindow.gif] 

The functionality of each display control will be covered in
subsequent exercises so we won't go over them here.

<div class="pagesubtitle">Display Control Menus</div>

In addition to the widgets, each display control has a set of 
menus associated with it that allow you to change the behavior of 
the control, change some of the display characteristics, or get 
help on using the control.  

<p>The menus can be accessed from the menu bar in the control
window:

<p>or by right clicking on the legend label:
