<faqitem q="Latest netCDF-Java Version" id="nj465">
  <p>
    The version of the netCDF-Java library currently distributed with the IDV is
    the 4.6.5. This is a bug fix release.  See
    the <a href="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/blogs/news/entry/netcdf-java-library-and-tds2">
      netCDF-Java Library</a> for a more details information.

<faqitem cat="Display Changes"></faqitem>

<faqitem q="Volume Vectors" id="vvectors">
  <p>
    The IDV can now display 3D volume vectors based on the x, y, and z wind component fields,
    the unit of the z componet wind could be in meter per second or in pascal per second.
  </p>
</faqitem>

<faqitem q="Volume Trajectories" id="vtrajectory">
  <p>
    The 3D volume trajectory is based on the new APIs of the VisAD library enhancements
    with much better performance. The volume trajectory display is categorized as 3D flow
    displays that also includes 3D vecotr cross section, 3D volume vector, 3D volume vector
    colored by speed, and 3D volume vector colored by another parameter. The 3D volume vector
    display could be created first and there is radio button to switch to the volume trajectory
    display. The start points of volume trajectory could be the whole volume of the gridded
    dataset or the selected level of the gridded dataset.

<faqitem q="Trajectory types" id="ttypes">
  <p>
    In addition to the traditional line trajecory display, ribbon, cylinder and deform ribbon are
    added as new trajectory dispaly types and are available in this release.

<faqitem q="Local McIDAS Area Files" id="larea">
    <p>
      The local McIDAS area files can be calibrated and spatially subset, currently only for the
      GVAR (GOES) area files in this release and we are working on area files from other satellites.
    </p>

<faqitem cat="Bug Fixes/Known Problems"></faqitem>

<faqitem q="Bug Fixes" id="bugfix">
  We fixed a few bugs associated with the time matching in this release. One of
  the bug is the excessive loading of data in the bundle when there is a derived
  of derived parameters. The another bug fixed is in the 3D grid trajectory
  display in which the time subset information not correctly saved in the
  bundle.
