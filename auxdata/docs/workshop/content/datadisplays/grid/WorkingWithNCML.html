<div class="overview">
<p> NcML is an XML representation of netCDF metadata, NcML is similar to the
netCDF CDL (network Common data form Description Language), except, of course, it uses XML syntax..

<ol class="step">
<li>A more advanced use of NcML is to modify existing NetCDF files. Displaying a bad netCDF grid
    dataset in the IDV can be frustrated.  I am giving a example here that shows how to fix
    a bad nc file before loading it to the IDV.
    <pre>
        netcdf X:/example/ecmf_2011032700_rh.nc {
         dimensions:
           x = 141;
           y = 61;
           z = UNLIMITED;   // (29 currently)
         variables:
           short ForecastHour(z=29);
             :units = "Degrees";
           float Longitude(x=141);
             :units = "Degrees";
           float Latitude(y=61);
             :units = "Hours";
           float RelativeHumidity_q25(z=29, y=61, x=141);
             :units = "Percent";
           float RelativeHumidity_q50(z=29, y=61, x=141);
             :units = "Percent";
           float RelativeHumidity_q75(z=29, y=61, x=141);
             :units = "Percent";

         :Title = "Relative Humidity Forecasts";
        }
    </pre>
    <p>
    There are several issues in the above netCDF file, the unit of the variable Latitude and the
    the variable ForecastHour are switched, and dimension Z should be time dimension. The following
    NcML file will do correction of naming and unit.
    </p>
    <pre>
     [gen::isl NcMLExample.ncml]   
    </pre>
    <p>
    What has been modified here is the name of dimension z and variable ForecastHour. The unit of Latitude
    is also corrected, and the unit of new variable Time is [ht::param hours since 2011-3-27 00:00:00 UTC] which includes
    the information from the original file name. The above xml syntax is save in a file with an ncml file extension
    [ht::param ecmf_2011032700_rh.ncml], and we can load this ncml file into the IDV for display. This is a very simple
    example, please visit [ht::popup "https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/ncml/" NcML] for complete information.
    </p>
</li>

<li>Another advanced use of NcML is to create virtual NetCDF datasets through aggregation. There
are two [ht::command Data Source Type] in the IDV,  [ht::param Aggregate Grids by Time] and
[ht::param Aggregate WRF netCDF Grids by Time], both using the built-in ncml to do the aggregation on the fly.
