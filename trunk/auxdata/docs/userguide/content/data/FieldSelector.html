The Field Selector is used to  list the loaded data sources, view
their available fields, subset (time and space) the field
and create displays. This is normally embedded in the Dashboard but
multiple Field Selectors can be shown with the 
[ug::menu File New {Field Selector Window}] menu.

<subhead intoc="false" id="overview">Overview</subhead>
After <a href="choosers/index.html">choosing</a> some data
creating a display is just a couple of steps away:
<ol>


[ug::step {Click on the data source of interest in the Data Sources list:} images/SelectorStep1.gif]

[ug::step {Select the field you want to display:}  images/SelectorStep2.gif]


[ug::step {Select the display type:}  images/SelectorStep3.gif]

[ug::step {Optionally subset the times by clicking off the Use Default button and selecting the times:}  images/SelectorStep4.gif]


[ug::step {For grids, optionally subset the levels and/or spatial area:} images/SelectorStep5.gif]

[ug::step {Press &quot;Create Display&quot;:} images/SelectorStep6.gif]

</ol>


<subhead intoc="false" id="datasources">Data Sources</subhead>

The left panel shows <b>Data Sources</b>, chosen as described in 
<a href="choosers/index.html">Choosing Data Sources</a>.
You can right click on a data source in the list to show a popup menu:

[ht::cimg images/DataSourceMenu.gif {Data Source Popup Menu}]

This allows you to Remove the data source (also by pressing the Delete key),
reload its data, show its <a href="DataSourceProperties.html">Properties window</a>,
etc.
<p>
The [ug::menu {Save as Quick Link}] item will save this data source
off as a <i>favorite</i> and make it available in the &quot;Favorite Data Sources&quot;
tab of the Quick Links tab of the Dashboard.


<subhead intoc="false" id="fields">Fields</subhead>

Selecting a data source in the left panel will list the 
available fields  in the <b>Fields</b> tree. 
This list is usually hierarchical showing
different categories of fields (e.g., 2D grids, 3D grids, image 
sequences, etc.).
To see the fields under a particular category
click on the toggle icon <img src="images/TreeTagClosed.gif">.

<p>

Selecting a field will show the list of displays available
in the <b>Displays</b> list and subsetting  information
(e.g., times, spatial subset).


<subhead intoc="false" id="subsetting">Subsetting</subhead>

The &quot;Subsetting&quot; component of the Field Selector
allows you to subset the data in both time and space (if possible).
If there are times in the data source you are viewing they
will be shown in this area. Likewise, if it is possible
to do spatial subsetting or decimation a  &quot;Spatial Subset&quot;
tab will be shown.

<p>
Time and spatial subsetting defaults can be applied to the data source
itself through the <a href="DataSourceProperties.html">Data Source Properties</a>
dialog or the defaults can be overwritten through the Field
Selector window.


<subhead intoc="false" id="displays">Creating Displays</subhead>

The <b>Display</b> tree shows a hierarchical  list of the available
displays for a particular field.
Click on the type of display you want from the choices listed in the
<b>Displays</b> tree. You can see examples of 
<a href="../examples/index.html">Display Types</a> in this Users Guide.

<p>

You can select two or more displays (different display types) at
one time. For an additional display, hold down the CTRL key and click on
the second display type desired. Then go ahead and create the display
as normal; all selected displays will be made.
To make the display click on the button <b>Create display</b>(or double click
on the display).


<subhead  intoc="false" id="derivedparms">Derived Parameters</subhead>

The IDV provides <b>derived parameters</b> -- 
parameters not provided by the original source data, but made from 
the source data with computations by the IDV.  The intent
is to provide commonly used fields such as dewpoint  when
dewpoint is not provided by the data source, but when it can be derived
from source data such as humidity and temperature.

<p>

These automatic derived parameters are offered when the
required data to compute them are available, based on parameter
names.

<p>

Since few data sets use  the same names for parameters,
the IDV keeps of a list of "aliases" or particular parameter names
that match with "canonical" names which are generally understood by
all IDV users and which the IDV uses for computations.
You can add your special parameter names to the list of aliases.
Read the <a href="../tools/AliasEditor.html">Parameter Alias</a> section
in this guide for information on using that facility.

<p>

All needed source parameters for one derived parameter must
come from one single data source, for example, from one single
netCDF file. The IDV attempts to find derived parameters that can
be made from data in each data source in the data source panel, but not from
all possible combination of data sources.
If you had separate files of u and v wind components, 
for example, the parameter names or aliases will not
create Derived wind vectors.



<subhead  intoc="false" id="formula">Formula Data Source</subhead>

You can create your own formulas
using  the <a href="../tools/Formulas.html">IDV Formulas</a> facility.
The <b>Formulas</b> data source in the Field Selector is a special
data source and lists all of the available end user formulas.
You can right-click on the data source to create new formulas 
and  import and export formulas. The formulas are listed in the Fields
tree.  Right clicking on one of the formulas listed in the Fields tree
allows you to edit, copy or evaluate the formula.

<p>
You can select a formula just like any other field and create a display
from it. However, the formula, when evaluated to create the display,
usually  needs one or more other data fields to act on. In this case 
a special Field Selector window is shown that allows the user to
select the fields for the formula. (Note: the fields you select here
can also be formula fields resulting in further field selection).
