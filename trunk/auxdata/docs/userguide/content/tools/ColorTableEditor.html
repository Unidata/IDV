<subhead intoc="false" id="intro">Introduction</subhead>


The Integrated Data Viewer provides a  Color Table Editor which 
supports editing existing color tables
and creating new ones. A color table is an ordered collection of colors
that is used to color a display according to a range of data values.

<subhead intoc="false" id="starting">Starting the Color Table Editor</subhead>

The Color Table Editor can be used stand-alone by
selecting the  [ug::menu Tools {Color Table Editor}]  menu item from the main
menu bar.
It can also be used or in conjunction with a particular display
by clicking on the display's color bar in the <a href="../controls/index.html#legends">legend</a>, 
or through the display's <a href="../controls/index.html#menus">edit menu</a>.
When used in conjunction with a particular display the changes you make to the
color table are applied to the display as you make them. 
To turn this off use the [ug::button Auto Update] check box in the lower right
corner of the window.

<p>

The Color Table Editor starts with a color table loaded in it. If
you are working with a data display, the color table in the editor is
the same as in the display.
If you want to use or edit a different color table, use the 
[ug::menu {Color Tables}] menu to select from  the categorized list of color tables:

[ht::cimg images/ColorTablesMenu.gif]


Color tables are grouped into categories, as illustrated. 
The illustration shows the color tables for the "Basic" category.
Click on a category and then on a color table to select.

<p>

To switch to the newly selected color table for a
display on screen, click on <b>OK</b> in the bottom of the Color Table Editor, and the 
editor will close, or click on <b>Apply</b> to keep the editor in use.
If [ug::button Auto Update] is checked the change takes place without further action by 
you, as soon as you select a new color table.


<subhead intoc="false" id="legend">Color Legend</subhead>


The color table is shown in the bar of color across the
window, the color legend.  How many colors are in the
table is shown in a label in the upper center, such as "70 colors."  
You can reduce or increase the number of colors by clicking on the
<b>-/+</b> choices near the left and right ends of the
legend. New colors are added or removed 
at each end of the legend with the same color as the end color.
Pressing Shift-Click on any of these buttons will add/remove 10 color 
slots at a time.

<p>

Underneath the color legend is a black and white checker board pattern to help show
the degree of transparency. Most color tables have zero transparency and
the checker board is not visible.

<p>

The <b>History</b> undo/redo buttons in the upper left allow you to 
step forward and backward through the  changes you have made. Shift-clicking
on these buttons will step forward/back 10 changes.

<p>

The spectrum of colors spans a range of data values. The values are shown 
at the ends of the color legends. You can change the max and min of the 
range 
with the <b>Range:</b> pair of dialog boxes on the right. Enter
the minimum and maximum values of the range you need, and click
Apply or Ok, or press the Enter key.
If the Color Table Editor is being used in conjunction with a display
then when you change the range that range is applied to the display as well.


<subhead intoc="false" id="painting">Painting and Editing Colors</subhead>

You can "paint" in the color bar by just dragging the mouse within it. When
your mouse is over the color bar the cursor will change to  a paintbrush and
a gray line is drawn to indicate the position of the cursor.
<p>
The type of painting is specified by the Paint Mode buttons.
<ul>
<li> [ug::button Fill]. When you drag
it will fill the color table with the currently chosen
color in the color chooser.  
<li> [ug::button Interpolate]. Apply  a linear interpolation 
from where you started dragging the breakpoint to the color value of 
where the breakpoint is currently  at while dragging. 
<li> [ug::button Transparency]. Apply the given transparency
value (in the editable pull down menu) to the color table where
you are dragging the breakpoint.
</ul>


<subhead intoc="false" id="breakpoints">Breakpoints</subhead>

The editor uses &quot;breakpoints&quot; indicated along the top of the 
color legend bar with little triangles and a number. Clicking
on a break point makes it active. The number on an active breakpoint is 
in <b>bold</b> characters.  There is only one active
breakpoint at a time. Making a new breakpoint makes the new breakpoint active.
<p>
Breakpoints are used for a number of things: showing the data value at a point
along the color table and changing
colors specific color values or ranges.
<p>

The values on the breakpoints are determined by the position of the
breakpoint along the legend, proportional to the min and max of the
Range. Changing the minimum and maximum of the Range 
changes the break point values.

<p>

You can move the active breakpoint several ways:
<ul>
<li> Drag on it with the mouse pointer;
<li> Move in small increments with the right or left arrow keys. (If there
is no response, first mouse click on the breakpoint.)
<li> Move in bigger steps with the shift-arrow keys.
<li> Right-click on the breakpoint and use the pop-up menu 
item  [ug::menu {Change Breakpoint}] .
</ul>


<p>

If you have the &quot;Actively set color&quot; checkbox selected then when you change the color in the color
chooser at the bottom then that color will be applied to the color slot under the selected breakpoint.
This allows you to set the color of a specific color slot.

<p>
You can also change colors and manipulate breakpoints 
using a right mouse click popup menu on a breakpoint:

[ht::cimg images/colortable/BreakpointsChoice.gif]


The choices are:
<ul>
<li> [ug::menu {Remove Breakpoint}]. <br>  
Remove the active breakpoint.
<li> [ug::menu {Change Breakpoint}]. <br>  
Set the breakpoint value.
<li> [ug::menu {Add Breakpoint} Here]. <br> 
Add a new breakpoint where you clicked  on the legend.

<li> [ug::menu {Add Breakpoint} {At Data Point}]. <br> 
Add a new breakpoint at a data value. You will be given a dialog box to enter the value in.

<li> [ug::menu {Add Breakpoint}  {At Beginning}]. <br>
Add a new breakpoint on the left end.

<li> [ug::menu {Add Breakpoint} {At End}]. <br> 
Add a new breakpoint on right end.

<li> [ug::menu {Set Colors} { Interpolate Left}]. <br>
Starting with the color at the active
breakpoint, interpolate colors to the left up to the next breakpoint.

<li> [ug::menu {Set Colors} {Interpolate Right}]. <br>
Starting with the color at the active
breakpoint, interpolate colors to the right up to the next breakpoint.

<li> [ug::menu {Set Colors}  {Fill Left}]. <br>
Starting with the color at the active
breakpoint, fill colors to the left up to the next breakpoint with
that single color.

<li> [ug::menu {Set Colors} {Fill Right}]. <br> 
Starting with the color at the active
breakpoint, fill colors to the right up to the next breakpoint with
that single color.

<li> [ug::menu {Set Colors} {Transparency Left}]. <br> 
All color table values from the active 
breakpoint to the next breakpoint to the left
are set with the transparency value.

<li> [ug::menu {Set Colors} {Transparency Right}]. <br> 
All color table values from the active
breakpoint to the next breakpoint to the right
get the transparency value.
</ul>



<subhead intoc="false" id="saveCT">Saving, Importing and Exporting</subhead>

You can modify an existing color table, or edit an existing color
table and save it with a new name to make a new color table. Any new
or modified color table can be saved for future use.

<p>

To save a new or modified color table simply select the
the [ug::menu File Save]  menu item.
To save a modified color table as a new color table, select
[ug::menu File {Save As}]  and enter the new name in the dialog box that
appears. This new color table will now be permanently saved in your
local collection of color tables.


<p>

To save a color table as a file which can be shared with others in
their IDV, select  the  [ug::menu File Export] menu item.
A file dialog will appear that will
allow you to save the color table as an XML-format file. We suggest
you use a file extension of <b>.xidvct</b>. 

<p>

To use a color table as a file which has been supplied to 
you by another IDV user, select the  [ug::menu File Import] menu item. 
A file dialog will appear that will
allow you to find the color table as an XML-format file. 




<subhead intoc="false" id="chooser">Color Chooser</subhead>


[ht::cimg images/colorchooser/ColorChooser.gif {The Color Chooser, HSB panel}]


The Color Chooser, in the lower half of the 
Color Table Editor window, allows you to select any possible color.

<p>

There are two tabs on the chooser, <b>HSB</b> and <b>RGB</b>, 
each with its own control panels. The
RGB panel shows a window that lets you 
specify any color by slider bars for R, G, and B values. R, G, and B are
red-green-blue
settings that control the intensity of the color guns in a CRT. 
The only color sample of an RGB value 
is the color of the active breakpoint in the legend, which can be 
pretty small and hard to see clearly.  Also, RGB values are not intuitive
 -- to get yellow you mix equal amounts of red and green in RGB.
We recommend you use the HSB chooser panel unless you have specific RGB
values to set.

<h4>The HSB Chooser</h4>

<p>

The HSB chooser allows you to control color by hue, saturation, and
brightness, thereby making any color.
With the HSB panel and tab shown, click on one of 
the circles marked <b>H</b>, <b>S </b>, or
<b>B</b> for the corresponding control for hue, saturation, or
brightness.

<p>

Hue is the term indicating a pure color selection from the
spectrum. Saturation is an indication of how much white is added to
the hue. 100% saturation is pure hue with no white. 
Brightness is an indication of how much black is added to
the hue. 100% brightness has no black and maximum
brilliancy, but can be any saturation from the hue to pure white.
0% brightness is solid black.

<p>

Some "colors" are not found in the spectrum and are a mixture of a
hue and black or white or both black and white. For example, brown is 
red-orange and some black. 
Grays are any hue with low saturation and some degree of brightness from black
to white -- basically a mixture of white and black.

<p>

You need only use one of
the controls for H, S, or B to make any color.  It's merely a matter
of which one is easiest for you.  Often the <b>H</b> control is
the easiest and most intuitive to use. We often think first in terms
of colors (hues),
and next in terms of how pale or dark a color of that hue we want.
The <b>H</b> control works that way. <b>You can select any possible
color with the HSB color chooser in the H setting.</b>

<p>

All this is easier to understand while using the HSB panel, with
<b>H clicked on</b>:

[ht::cimg images/colorchooser/Hue.gif {The HSB Hue chooser, set on green with high S and high B}]



The slider bar chooses the pure hue. Once you have chosen
a hue, clicking or dragging the mouse
on the square color display chooses degrees of saturation and
brightness -- how much white or black is added in --
for that hue. Using the HSB Hue display you can 
make any color after a little practice.

<p>

Note that the right edge of every hue chooser is a gray scale,
and the bottom is pure black.

<p>

The <b>Saturation Chooser (S)</b> has a slider bar with the full range
of saturation (how much white is added to the color): 


[ht::cimg images/colorchooser/Saturation.gif {The HSB Saturation chooser set on the same green}]


Select hue and brightness by dragging the mouse over the colored
square.The bottom is always solid black. If you want true shades 
of colors -- pure hue with only black and no white -- use the S
control with the slider at the top. There are no grays or
pale colors in this case.

<p>

The <b>Brightness Chooser (B)</b> has a slider bar with the full range
of brightness (how much black is added to the color): 

[ht::cimg images/colorchooser/Brightness.gif {The HSB Brightness chooser set on the same green}]


Select hue and saturation by dragging the mouse over the colored
square.The bottom is always pale gray going to white. If you want to use
colors
that are all at full
brightness, use the B control with the slider at the top. Note
that colors such as brown are not available in this setting, and there
are no dark colors.

<p>

All controls in the HSB panel show the RGB values for any color selected, in
case
you need to know the RGB values for another use.
