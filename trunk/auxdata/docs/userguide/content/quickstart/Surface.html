In the <a href="../data/choosers/index.html">Data Chooser</a> select the 
<b>Point</b> tab.   

[ht::cimg ../data/choosers/images/PointChooser.gif]

In the <b>Server:</b> entry box, use the pull down list to select
a remote server with METAR data, such as <b>adde.ucar.edu</b>. You can also
type a different server name into the entry box.
In the <b>Data type:</b> selection box you choose between Surface
(METAR) Data and Synoptic data.
Click on <b>Connect</b> to find data on the remote server.
You can choose either the latest <b>N</b> times or select
specific time.  Select the times you would like to view (note: multiple times
may be selected with the <i>Shift</i> and <i>Control</i> keys).
The <b>Station Model</b> selector allows you to select the preferred
plot type for this data.  For this exercise, use the <b>METAR</b>
station model type.  Click on <b>Add Source</b> when you have made 
your selection.


<subhead id="display" intoc="false">Making the display</subhead>

The surface observation data will be shown in  the
<a href="../data/FieldSelector.html">Field Selector window</a>.

[ht::cimg images/PointSelector.gif]

Select "Point Data" in the <b>Field</b> panel and select "Point Data
Plot" in the <b>Displays</b> panel.
Make the display by clicking on <b>Create Display</b> button on the bottom
of the Field Selector window.

To declutter the display, and to 
change how the display elements at each station are selected and arranged, 
use the   
<a href="../controls/StationModelControl.html">Station Model Control</a>
and the 
<a href="../tools/StationModelEditor.html">Station Model Editor</a>.
