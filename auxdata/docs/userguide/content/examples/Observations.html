You can make plots of point data such as meteorological surface (METAR)
and synoptic surface weather station observations.

For more information see
<a href="../quickstart/Surface.html">Getting Started: Surface Observation Plots</a>.
You can change the plot layout with the
<a href="../tools/StationModelEditor.html">Station Model Editor</a>.

You can plot non-meteorological point data as well.  The image below depicts
the locations of earthquakes, sized by magnitude and colored by depth.

<subhead id="track" intoc="false">Track Displays</subhead>

Aircraft and drifting buoy tracks can be plotted to show the path
of the sensor. You can also plot the track data as observations along with the
track.
