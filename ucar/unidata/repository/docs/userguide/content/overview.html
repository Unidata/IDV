[ht::head {RAMADDA Overview}]

RAMADDA is based around a collection of Groups and  Entries.
This is analagous to your file system where you have Directories and
Files. 
All content and actions that are available to entrys are also
available to groups. Groups simply also can contain other entries and groups.
