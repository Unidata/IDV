There are several methods to zoom, pan, and rotate in the IDV. You
can use the mouse, the arrow keys, a rubber band box, or the Zoom/Pan
Toolbar. To reset to the initial base viewpoint use the key combination
Control-r.

<p>

<i>Note: You need to click in the view window when using key combinations.</i>

<i>Note: If you are using an Apple Mac with a single button mouse, see  <a href="#mac">below</a></i>.

<subhead id="mac" intoc="false">Apple Mac One Button Mouse Controls</subhead>
Mouse controls are a bit more challenging if you are running the 
IDV on a Mac with a single mouse button. The typical left mouse button 
(MB1) functions are done with a click of the button.  
Right mouse options (MB3) are simulated using the <b>Option</b> 
key with a mouse click.  Use the following:<p>
<ul> 
<li>Option + click to rotate<br>
<li>Shift + Option + click to zoom
</ul>

There is no replacement for the mouse panning actions on the Mac.  Use
the keyboard arrow functions or the Viewpoint toolbar instead.





<subhead intoc="false" id="viewpoint">The Viewpoint Toolbar</subhead>

[ht::cimg images/ViewPointButtons.gif]

The Viewpoint Toolbar allows you to quickly switch the point of view to any of six
choices, including from overhead (the same as you see in a new display),
from below, and from north, east, south or west.  The buttons show
the side of the point of view looking into the 3D display volume.
Click on any of the buttons to change the point of view. The top
button for overhead is also useful if the display is in a confusing state and
you want to get oriented.

<p>

The other three buttons allow you to switch perspective between converging to infinity
and not converging, define your own viewpoint settings, and set the vertical limits.

<p>


You can specify  any viewpoint exactly from any angle in 3D you like
using the [ug::menu View Viewpoint {Viewpoint Dialog}] menu choice.



<subhead intoc="false" id="navigation">The Zoom/Pan Toolbar</subhead>

[ht::cimg images/NavButtons.gif]

The Zoom/Pan  Toolbar allows you to zoom and pan. 
Clicking on the "plus" icon zooms in,
centered on the center of the display. Clicking on the "minus" icon zooms out,
centered on the center of the display. Clicking on the "house" icon
restores the initial point of view of this projection 
(overhead, centered on center of the 
map projection in use). Clicking on one of the arrow buttons moves
the point of view in the direction of the button; the display moves in the
opposite direction. If you click on the up button, the map and display
move down.

<p>

You can "tear away" the toolbar and place it elsewhere on your
screen as a tiny window by dragging with the right mouse button on the
textured area
above the toolbar. Clicking on the x on the toolbar will then restore
the toolbar to its original location.

The Undo and Redo buttons allow you to undo or redo viewpoint changes.
