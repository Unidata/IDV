You can use the transparency features of the color table to 
see into the cloud.

{{Resolution}  {
You can adjust the size of the resample points to improve the quality of volume rendering with the Resolution Slide widget.
}}

{{Use 3D Texture} {
By default, the volume rendering uses a 3D Texture mode.  On some systems
(notably Macs), the volume may appear as a grey blog.  Unchecking this
option will use a different (although poorer quality) rendering mode.
