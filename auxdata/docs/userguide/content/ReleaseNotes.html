<faqitem q="Blue Marble Display" id="bluemarble">

According to <a href="http://onearth.jpl.nasa.gov/">NASA</a>: 

The JPL One Earth "server no longer provides full WMS services for any of the datasets.
 Furthermore, the MODIS daily mosaics are no longer being updated. The tiled WMS access, 
 described in the Tiled WMS and Google Earth KML support will stay operational. 
 This includes access to the archived of MODIS daily mosaics, which were built from 
 2006 to the end of 2010."
<p>

We have updated the IDV to point to the <a href="http://neowms.sci.gsfc.nasa.gov/wms/wms">NASA Earth Observations (NEO) WMS</a> This isn't an exact replacement, but it will do.

<faqitem q="Smoothing of grids" id="gridsmooth">
In situations where users have smoothed a grid, they can now revert back to an unsmoothed grid without having
 to reload the data. In addition, users can no longer smooth grids over topography fields. In this specific situation
 the user must smooth the grid via the IDV Jython formulas.
