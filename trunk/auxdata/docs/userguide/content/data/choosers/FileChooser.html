The  [ug::chooser Files] chooser allows you to select data from  your file system.

[ht::cimg images/FileChooser.gif {File Chooser}]

To select files:
<ol>
<li> Navigate to the directory that contains  the files you are interested in.
The  [ug::menu {Look In}] menu allows you to select directories or you can
double-click on directory names.  You can use the
[ug::menu {Directory History}] widget <img src="images/HistoryList16.gif"> to 
navigate to frequently used directories.  This list contains the 
last 15 directories that data was loaded from.  

<li> Select a file or files. Multiple files can be selected using 
Control-Click or Shift-Click.

<li> Optionally, specify the type of  data the file contains.
Normally the IDV figures out what kind of data is in a file by
the filename itself. You can override this 
using the [ug::menu {Data Source Type}] menu.

<li> The [ug::button Update] button causes a rescan of the current directory. 
Use this to update the file chooser if the files have changed.

<li> When done, load the selected file  with the [ug::button Add Source] button.

<li> The data file selected appears in the 
<a href="../FieldSelector.html">Field Selector</a>  window. 

</ol>
