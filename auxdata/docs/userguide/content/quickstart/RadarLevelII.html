This section describes how to  create displays from 
WSR-88D Level II data.  The set of steps include:

<%childlist%>


<subhead id="accessing" intoc="false">Accessing WSR-88D Level II Radar Data</subhead>

The Level II data is supplied as volume-scan files,                     
each file having all data from one WSR-88D radar                        
for all sweeps for one &quot;time&quot;. Unidata                        
Community sites can receive Level II data using the <a                  
href="https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/ldm/index.html">      
Unidata Local Data Manager (LDM)</a>. Archived Level II data is         
available from the <a href="http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/"> National        
Climatic Data Center (NCDC)</a> (data from NCDC must be un-tarred).

<p>
The files should be stored on your file system with each station's files 
in a directory (folder) whose directory name is the station 
4-character ID (e.g., KTLX for Oklahoma City).  In many cases the data
files do not have any location information in them and the IDV uses the
directory name as a first guess at the station location.  Otherwise,
use the [ug::label Radar Location] widget to specify the location.

<subhead id="chooser" intoc="false">Choosing Level II Radar Data</subhead>

In the <a href="../data/choosers/index.html">Data Source Chooser</a>
window click on the <b>Radar</b> tab and then the 
<b>Level II</b> tab.

[ht::cimg ../data/choosers/images/Level2Chooser.gif]

Use the file chooser to find the directory which holds the data you     
want to display. Click on a file name you desire (multiple files can be 
selected with the <i>Shift</i> or <i>Control</i> keys) or select
the latest <b>N</b> files. When you have   
selected all files you need, click the <b>Add Source</b> button.  

<subhead id="displays1" intoc="false">Making Level II Radar Displays</subhead>

The data source is shown in the 
<a href="../data/FieldSelector.html">Field Selector window</a>. 
Level II     
data has three moments or data types: Reflectivity, RadialVelocity,    
and SpectrumWidth. The IDV has several kinds of displays for Level II  
data. Any of the moments can be shown with any of the displays. Here we 
will use examples showing reflectivity. Clicking on the "Reflectivity"  
entry in the <b>Field</b> panel will show the list of available         
displays in the <b>Displays</b> panel.

<subhead id="2displays" intoc="false">2D Displays of Individual Sweeps</subhead>

[ht::cimg images/LevelIIPPI2D.gif {Level-II 3D Display}]

Select the <b>Radar Sweep View in 2D</b> in the <b>Displays</b> panel and    
click on <b>Create Display</b>. <b>Radar Sweep View in 2D</b> plots the      
data as an colored image on the base of the 3D display area. This       
mimics conventional PPI plots on a map. 

<p>

The 
<a href="../controls/level2/RadarSweepControl.html">Radar Sweep Control</a> 
allows you to change which sweep elevation you want         
to see. You can add range rings with the [ug::menu Displays {Add        
Range Rings}] menu item. You can modify the range rings with the        
<a href="../controls/misc/RadarGridControl.html">Radar Range Rings      
control</a>.                                                            



<subhead id="3ddisplays" intoc="false">3D Displays of Individual Sweeps</subhead>

[ht::cimg images/LevelIIPPI3D.gif {Level-II 3D Display}]

Select the <b>Radar Sweep View in 3D</b> entry in the <b>Displays</b> panel. 
<b>Radar Sweep View in 3D</b> plots the data as an colored image, with the   
data plotted in 3D space at the elevation where the sweep occurred. You 
can <a href="../ui/Navigation.html">rotate</a> the display to see the   
three dimensional nature.                                               

<p> 

You can use this display to merge radar data display with upper         
air data such as the IDV plots of NOAA Profiler data. Since             
the Earth is projected onto a flat surface in this display,             
the sweep has a shape very close to a rotated parabola. The <a          
href="../controls/level2/SweepControl.html">Radar Sweep Control</a>     
allows you to change which sweep elevation to display.                  


<subhead id="rhi" intoc="false">Pseudo-RHI Displays in 2D and 3D</subhead>

[ht::tblimg  {images/LevelIIRhi2D.gif {Level-II 2D RHI}} {images/LevelIIRhi3D.gif {Level-II 3D RHI}}]

Select <b>RHI</b> in the <b>Displays</b> panel and press <b>Create Display</b>.
<b>RHI</b> plots the data as an colored vertical cross section at the true 
elevations of the beams in 3D space (bottom illustration). This pseudo-RHI is 
constructed from several horizontal sweeps of the radar. You may have to rotate 
the display to see the RHI in 3D. 

<p> 

The beam width is indicated by the vertical extent of each colored 
vertical stripe, corresponding to a bin beam bin sample. Beam overlap is clear. 
Position of the RHI in azimuth can be adjusted by dragging the little box 
on the end of the selector line above the RHI. 

<p>

The 2D plot of pseudo-RHI (top illustration) is shown in the <a         
href="../controls/level2/RhiControl.html">RHI Control</a>. That control 
also has an auto-rotate feature. The RHI displays have time animation.  


<subhead id="allsweeps" intoc="false">All Sweeps in 3D</subhead>

[ht::cimg images/LevelIIVolumeScan.gif {Level-II Volume Scan}]

Select "Reflectivity" in the <b>Field</b> panel and select <b>Volume    
Scan (all sweeps)</b> in the <b>Displays</b> panel. <b>Volume Scan (all 
sweeps)</b> plots the data as 3D field of points colored by value. Each 
point is a bin value; all sweeps and bins are shown.                    

<subhead id="isosurface" intoc="false">Radar Isosurfaces in 3D</subhead>

Select "Reflectivity" in the <b>Field</b> panel and select              
<b>Radar Isosurface</b> in the <b>Displays</b> panel. An isosurface
is a 3D analog of a contour line. It shows the location of all data     
with a single data value. Interpolation is used between sweep altitudes 
in the IDV isosurface plot of Level II data. All data in a volume       
scan is used. The example shown is the 50 dBZ isosurface from a line    
of thunderstorms crossing Oklahoma at 1330Z 11 Sept 2003. Vertical      
exaggeration is 13 to 1.
