[ht::cimg ../controls/images/ProfileControlGui.gif]


A vertical profile is a display of samples 
of a 3D parameter along a vertical
line from top to bottom of the available data.
The vertical profile appears in a separate window. 

<p>

The  position of the profile
is shown in the main mapped 3D display  by a vertical
line/selector point is used
select the profile position.

[ht::cimg  ../controls/images/ProbeControlGui.gif]


The data probe shows the value of one or more parameters at a 
single location.  A small colored  selector point
in the main IDV display shows where the probe is located.
You can use multiple probes at different locations.

<a href="../controls/ProbeControl.html">Data Probe Control</a>.


<subhead id="timeheightdisplay">Time-Height Display</subhead>
 
[ht::cimg ../controls/images/TimeHeightControlGui.gif]


A time-height display
is a display of samples of a 3D parameter along a vertical
profile line from top to bottom of the available data, with time as the
independent coordinate (x axis).

<p>

The display appears in a separate window. The window can
be enlarged by dragging the edges of the border with the mouse
button to see more detail. The values on the plot can be sampled by
dragging the middle mouse button over the plot. 
The map position of the
vertical profile is indicated by the <b>Lat: Long:</b> readout 
above the graph .

<p>

The map position of the profile
is shown in the main 3D view window by a colored vertical
line. There is a selector point
on top of the vertical line.  
You can move the vertical profile line
over the map  by dragging the selector point with the left mouse button.

For more information see 
<a href="../controls/TimeHeightControl.html">Time-Height Control</a>.
 



<subhead id="timeseriesdisplay">Time Series Display</subhead>
 

[ht::cimg ../controls/images/TimeSeriesControlGui.gif]

For one location in the IDV display
 you can make a plot of data values 
as a function of time with the <b>Time Series</b> display choice.

<p>

To learn how to request a display, see
<a href="../data/FieldSelector.html">the Data Selector Window</a>.



The display appears in a separate window. 

The position of the sample point
  is shown in the main 3D view window by the bottom of a  colored square.
  You can move the position 
  over the map by dragging the square point with the  mouse button.

<!-- The values on the plot can be sampled by
  dragging the middle mouse button over the plot.
  The map location of the sample
  is indicated by the "Lat: Long:" readout 
  above the graph.
<p>
You can zoom in on the graph by holding down the
  Shift key and dragging the mouse pointer up while pressing the left
  mouse button; drag down to zoom out.  You can pan
  the graph by holding down the
  Ctrl key and dragging the mouse pointer in any direction while pressing the left
  mouse button.
<p>
The bottom of the window includes 
  a color selection for the graph line and Selector
  Point, a visibility toggle,
  and a button to remove the display entirely.
