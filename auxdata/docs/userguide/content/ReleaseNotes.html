<faqitem cat="System Changes"></faqitem>

<faqitem q="Java Version 1.8" id="jv18">
  <p>
    Migrated the IDV to Java 8 and Java3D 1.6. The IDV is now using Java 1.8 JVM
    on all platforms of this release.
  </p>
</faqitem>

<faqitem q="Jython 2.7" id="jython">
  <p>
    Updated the Jython library to version 2.7.
  </p>
</faqitem>

<faqitem q="DOI" id="doi">
  <p>
    For improved citation purposes, the IDV now has a Digital Object Identifier
    (DOI): doi:10.5065/D6RN35XM.
  </p>
</faqitem>

<faqitem q="Latest netCDF-Java Version" id="nj46">
  <p>
    The version of the netCDF-Java library currently distributed with the IDV is
    the 4.6.2. Its main feature is a rewrite of GRIB handling. This version of
    netCDF-Java includes changes: AWIPSsat projection, WRF lat/lon coordinates
    with time dependence, Updated grib1 table for NLDAS, handling of scalar
    runtime coordinate for GRIB collections.  See
    the <a href="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/blogs/news/entry/netcdf_java_library_and_tds10">
      netCDF-Java Library</a> for a more details on these changes.

<faqitem cat="Display Changes"></faqitem>

<faqitem q="Forecast hour added" id="fhour">
  <p>
    The IDV can now calculate the forecast hours based on the run time
    coordinate system and values can be accessed through the forecast hour macro
    in the display properties window.
  </p>
</faqitem>

<faqitem q="New Grid Trajectory and Curly Vector" id="ngtrajectory">
  <p>
    The new 2D grid trajectory and the curly vector display are based on the new
    APIs of the VisAD library.  Both displays are categorized as flow vector
    display. The vector plan view display will be created first and there are
    radio buttons to switch to the trajectory or curly vector display. The
    trajectory and the curly vector can also be colored by the wind speed.
  </p>
</faqitem>

<faqitem q="3D Adaptive Resolution" id="3dAR">
  <p>
    The Adaptive Resolution (AR) feature in the IDV has been expanded to cover
    several 3 dimensional displays. When creating a 3D display or cross section
    display, the IDV calculates the resolution of the map view window,
    dynamically sets the data sampling in all 3 dimensions, and loads sufficient
    data to generate the image.
  </p>
</faqitem>

<faqitem q="Support for CF Trajectory Format" id="cftraj">
  <p>
    The IDV now supports the reading and display of trajectory data as described
    in
  <a href="http://cfconventions.org/Data/cf-conventions/cf-conventions-1.7/build/aphs04.html">H.4. Trajectory
    Data</a> of the CF conventions.

<faqitem q="VisAD Vertical Scale Labeling" id="vlab">
  <p>
    Incorporated improved vertical scale labeling available in from VisAD.
  </p>

<faqitem cat="Bug Fixes/Known Problems"></faqitem>

<faqitem q="Bug Fixes" id="bugfix">
  We fixed a few bugs associated with the time matching in this release. One of
  the bug is the excessive loading of data in the bundle when there is a derived
  of derived parameters. The another bug fixed is in the 3D grid trajectory
  display in which the time subset information not correctly saved in the
  bundle.
