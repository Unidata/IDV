The Layout Model Editor composes the layout and style used to plot
data on a map from observations at
discrete points (e.g., weather observations). 

<p>

The Layout Model Editor is used to edit existing models or to create
new models.  The Editor is opened  with the 
[ug::menu Tools {Layout Model Editor}] menu.

[ht::cimg images/StationModelEditor.gif {Layout Model Editor}]


To see any model, use the [ug::menu {Layout Models}] menu. 
The models that the user has edited or created
will have "(local)" after the name.

<p>

The display shows a horizontal line and a vertical line through the
observation location. These axis lines give a reference point.
A station model consists of a set of shapes which 
are added  by clicking on an item in the left
column  and then clicking where you want to place it (relative to the
observation center point or location point). It will appear with a
surrounding outline box and 8 control points you can drag to resize
the item. When a shape is created its property dialog is shown (described below).

<p>

Shapes can be moved by dragging with the mouse.
Click on any item with the right mouse button to see a pop-up menu of 
choices to control its appearance. You can delete an item, set its
color, or change font sizes, view its properties, etc.

<p>


Each item has a single red "Alignment point" that is used for to locate
the actual displays with respect to the center point of the observation.
So, for example, say you want a text label (whose actual width in the
main display depends on the data it is showing) to be aligned so that
its upper right corner is at the latitude of the observation and a little right.
You would set the shape's alignment point to be &quot;NW&quot;
and then position the shape so that the Y of the alignment point  is
on the X-axis and the X of the point is a bit right of center.

<p>
The [ug::menu Center] menu in the popup-menu allows you to center the alignment
point vertically and horizontally.

<p>

You can also align a collection of shapes.
First select the shapes (shift-click).
Then select one of the six alignment icons under the top menu bar; the left most
icon means align all the selected items under a horizontal line.

<p>





To save a station model  you have composed, use the
[ug::menu File {Save}] or [ug::menu File {Save As...}] 
menu items.  When you save a station model any point data displays
that are using it will be updated. To remove a model, use the 
[ug::menu File Remove]
menu item. You cannot remove a model supplied with the IDV, but you can
remove local models.

<p>


You use the [ug::menu Properties] choice in the pop-up menu
to show the properties dialog window for that shape. The properties
dialog is made up of a number of tabs. 

<p>
Note: The [ug::button Apply] and [ug::button OK] buttons applies the properties
to the shape in the editor. The [ug::button OK] and [ug::button Cancel] buttons
closes this dialog. The [ug::button Save] button does and apply and also saves
the station model as a whole (just like doing [ug::menu File Save]). 
When the station model is saved then any displays that are using it are updated.
The [ug::button Save] button allows you to see what your changes to the properties
will look  like in the main display.


<ul>
<li> Display:
[ht::cimg images/StationModelPropertiesDisplay.gif {Properties Dialog - Display}]

This tab allows you to  assign which observation variable is associated with that item.
Numerical values should appear in a "Value" item, text in a "Text"
item, etc. You can also set units and the display format.
<p>

Parameter identifiers within a station model can hold embedded Jython code.
This allows you to do operations on the values and provide more extensive formatting.
Any parameter that begins with &quot;=&quot; is treated as a Jython
expression. For example, you can enter:<pre>
=T-TD
</pre>
to calculate the dewpoint depression.
You can format the text that is shown. For example you can enter:
<pre>
='TD:'+str(T-TD)
</pre>
This will result in the calculation of T-TD, a conversion  of that result to
a string which is then concatenated to the string 'TD:'.
If you want to format the result of the numeric calculation using the format
specifier from the properties dialog simply enter:
<pre>
='TD:'+format(T-TD)
</pre>


<p>&nbsp;

<li> Color By:
[ht::cimg images/StationModelPropertiesColorBy.gif {Properties Dialog - Color By}]
This tab allows you to specify a parameter that is used to color the shape.
You can specify a data range (and a corresponding unit for the data range, e.g.,
celsius). This data range is used as the end point ranges for the specified
color table. 
<p>
For example, in the above image the Temperature parameter has been specified
with data range -90-45 celsius.
For each display the IDV will find the Temperature value (e.g., 15 celsius), convert it,
if necessary to the specified unit, find its where is lays within the range and use
the corresponding color from the color table.

<p>&nbsp;

<li> Color From:
[ht::cimg images/StationModelPropertiesColorFrom.gif {Properties Dialog - Color From}]
This allows you to specify parameter, a set of (regular expression) patterns and a corresponding color.
If the text value of the parameter matches one of the patterns then the given color is used
to color the shape. For example, if your point data had a &quot;fruit&quot; field in it 
(e.g., fruit=banana, apple, tangerine) you could define different colors for different
values of fruit.
<p>
To get more lines press the [ug::button Apply] button.




<p>&nbsp;
<li> Scale Size By:
[ht::cimg images/StationModelPropertiesScaleBy.gif {Properties Dialog - Scale Size By}]
This allows you to specify a parameter to scale the shape by. It works similarly to the
Color By facility described above. You specify a parameter, a data range (with a unit if desired),
and a scale factor range. For each point display the IDV will find the value of the parameter,
determine where that value lies within the data range and find the corresponding
scaling from the scale factor range.


<p>&nbsp;

<li> Rotate By:
[ht::cimg images/StationModelPropertiesRotateBy.gif {Properties Dialog - Rotate By}]
This works like the scale and color by facilities. Specify a parameter, data range and
rotation range. Note, the rotation is about the Z axis in X/Y/Z space. It is not
a rotation in Lat/Lon space.


</ul>

You can define new symbol types using an xml file plugin. See <a href="stationsymbols.xml">here</a>
for an example.
