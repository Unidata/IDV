[header {IDV Developer Documentation}]

This documentation is intended to provide a comprehensive overview
of the IDV application framework. Since the IDV makes extensive use
of the VisAD framework for data model and visualization
facilities you may also be interested in that documentation
as well:

https://www.ssec.wisc.edu/~billh/visad.html</a>

<p>
Much of what you may need  to modify from the default IDV reference
application can probably be accomplished through  configuration
using the idv property and resource files.
This is described <a href="resources/index.html">here</a>.

<p>

In conjunction with this documentation we have also developed
an example IDV implementation that can serve as a working point
of reference for your.
The package,  [dg::package ucar.unidata.apps.example], contains a working  version
of an ExampleIdv application, a set of property files, rbi files,
resources, jnlp files, etc. It is is intended to give developers 
a comprehensive overview of how the IDV framework is structured and 
how to modify and/or add  new  functionality into the framework.
