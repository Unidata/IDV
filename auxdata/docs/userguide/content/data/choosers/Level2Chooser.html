Level II data from your file system.

To select Level II data:
<ol>

<li> Navigate to the desired directory. This chooser works like the
<a href="FileChooser.html">Files</a> chooser described above.

<li> Select one or more Level II data files. Use Control-Click or Shift-Click
to select multiple files. Each file represents a full volume scan at a particular time.

<li> Alternatively, use the [ug::button {Use Relative Times}] button
to select the latest <b>N</b> files in the directory.   You can optionally
use the [ug::button File Pattern] field to specify the pattern for 
files to look for.

<li> Provide a radar station  name. 
For some Level II data, the IDV  requires you to provide the radar location.
The IDV  will try to guess at the location based on the directory name but 
you can specify the location using the [ug::menu {Radar Location}] menu.

<li> When done, load the selected radar data with the [ug::button Add Source] button.


</ol>
