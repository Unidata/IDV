The script getImages.tcl gets started at boot time.
It runs continually, sleeping every 15 minutes.
It sources defineImages.tcl as an easy way to define the different
webcam images that are fetched.

To see if this is running do:
conan.unidata.ucar.edu: ps -eaf | grep getImages
  jeffmc  5273  5271  0   Oct 20 ?       2025:52 /opt/bin/tclsh ./getImages.tcl


Every time it fetches a new image it will run through the existing images and
only keep around the most recent 200 images. So, roughly speaking, we keep
around the last 2 days of images.

An overrall index.xml file that defines the image collections is written as
images/index.xml
images/index.html


All of the images are written to:
images/<collection>/...


The xml format is defined at:
https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/idv/docs/userguide/data/ImageMovie.html

There are also index files written which define the actual images and their times:
images/<collection>/index.xml


When you are debugging or trying out new images you can always run getImages.tcl directly:
     tclsh getImages.tcl

Passing in -help will list the command line arguments.

Typically, you do:
    tclsh getImages.tcl -total 1

Which would run it once and then exit

To start this up again in the background run:
batch <run &
