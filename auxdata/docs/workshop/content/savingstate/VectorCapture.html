<ol class="step">

  <li>Clear your displays and create a contour plan view.
  
  <li>Select the [ht::menu View Capture {Image...}] menu item from
      the map view's   menu bar. The [ht::dialog File Dialog] will popup.</li>
  
  <li>You can save the display as a PDF, Postscript or Scalable Vector Graphics file. [ht::save workshop.pdf]</li>
  
  <li> In the dialog that pops up select [ht::button Preview] and also enter some label text.</li>
  <li> On the workshop Linux machines run <i>evince</i> to view the PDF<pre>
evince workshp.pdf</pre>
  <ul>
    <li> Vector capture is a 2 stage process. The raster-like  displays (e.g., images) are captured then the vector displays (e.g., contours, maps).
  </ul>

  <li> Lets look at the limitations of vector catpure.
    <ul>
      <li> Leaving the contour plan view also create an isosurface display.
      <li> Make sure the contour plan view intersects the isosurface at some level.
      <li> Capture and view [ht::filename workshop2.pdf].
    </ul>
