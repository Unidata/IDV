The [ug::chooser Directory] chooser allows you to select files
in a directory by time.  You can select the most recent <b>N</b>
files or select all files updated in a specific time period.


[ht::cimg images/DirectoryChooser.gif {Directory Chooser}]

To select data from a directory you:
<ol>
<li> Specify the type of  data the file contains.
Normally the IDV figures out what kind of data is in a file by
the filename itself. You can override this 
using the [ug::menu {Data Source Type}] menu.

<li> Select the directory you want to poll on.

<li> Type in a name for the dataset that you want to show in the
<a href="FieldSelector.html">Field Selector</a>.

<li> Optionally, set the pattern for the files you want to poll on.
Use the check box to set whether you want to poll on hidden files.
You can verify the files that will be scanned using the pattern
by pressing the [ug::button Verify] button. 

<li> Choose the number of files you want to search for.  You 
can select an absolute number of files or you can select the
files that have been updated in a certain time period.

<li> If you want to have the files and associated displays 
automatically update, set the [ug::label Polling] information
and the update frequency.

<li> When done, load the selected data  with the 
[ug::button Add Source] button.

</ol>
