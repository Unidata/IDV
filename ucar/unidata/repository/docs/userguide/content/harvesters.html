[ht::head {Harvesters}]

<%nochildlist%>


If you are a site administrator you can create entry harvesters that will
scan either the server file system or will fetch web-based resources and 
automatically ingest them into the repository.
<p> 

Go to the <i>Harvesters</i> tab under the Admin page. This lists all of the Harvesters that are created
and allows you to create new Harvesters.
Enter a Name for a new Harvester, select a type (e.g., &quot;Local Files&quot; for a File Harvester) 
and press Create and you will be taken to the Edit form for the new Harvester.
From the main Harvesters tab you can always bring up this edit form for existing Harvesters.

<p>

The File Harvester lets you specify a directory root on the server file system and a regular expression
pattern that is used to match file names. Any files that are found are then added to the repository.
The repository is checked so as to not add duplicate files.



<subhead  id="run"  intoc="false">Run Settings</subhead>
The form has  settings for running the harvester. When you are first creating a harvester sometimes it
may takes some time to figure out just what you are harvesting and the name and group settings for the repository
entry. So, its good to turn on test mode. This will result in entries not being added to the repository when you run
the harvester. Rather, when in test mode, up to &quot;Count&quot; number of files will be found and the results will be
listed in the &quot;Information&quot; section of the harvester page.
<p>
The &quot;Active on startup&quot; flag, when set, results in the harvester being started when the repository
starts up. The &quot;Run continually&quot; flag has the harvester continually run. It uses the &quot;Every&quot; setting
to determine the pauses between runs. You can choose Absolute time to pause every N minutes. Or, you can choose
&quot;Minutes&quot; or &quot;Hourly&quot; to have it run relative to the hour or the day, e.g. &quot;3 hourly&quot;
will run at 0Z, 3Z, 6Z, 9Z, etc.\
<p>
For example, if you know you are getting data files  in real-time that are coming in every 30 minutes you could set your harvester
to run in &quot;Absolute&quot; mode every 15 minutes. If you had a Web harvester that is fetching images
you might want to use an &quot;Hourly&quot; setting to get the image at some fixed interval (e.g., 0Z, 6Z, 12Z, 18Z, etc).


<subhead  id="files" intoc="false">Files Settings</subhead>
Under &quot; Look for files&quot; you specify a directory on the server file system to scan and a regular expression to
match on the file name.
The repository will recursively scan the directory tree and any files it finds that matches the pattern it will
add to the repository. <p>
The regular expressions used are somewhat extended in that you can specify subsets of the regular expression
and use the result text for metadata and other information when creating the entry in the repository.
For example, a very common case is to have a date/time embedded in the filename. So, you could have in your regular 
expression something of the form:
<pre>
.*data(fromdate:\\d\\d\\d\\d\\d\\d\\d\\d_\\d\\d\\d\\d)\\.nc
</pre>

This would  match any files of the form:<pre>
data_yyyymmdd_hhmm.nc
</pre>
The &quot;(&quot; and &quot;)&quot; define the sub-expression (just like normal regular expression). But the
&quot;fromdate:&quot; is the special extension that tells the harvester that that sub-expression
is used to create the repository entry fromdate field.
<p>
The date format that is used is defined in the Date Format field and follows the
Java <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/api/java/text/SimpleDateFormat.html">date format</a> conventions.






<subhead  id="entry" intoc="false">Entry Creation</subhead>


When creating an entry we need to know the group to put it under, its name and description.
You specify templates for these that can contain a set of macros (see below).
Note: this is where the Test mode described above is useful. Sometimes it takes a while to figure
just what you want in terms of group structure and entry names.

<p>

To define the group you need to select an existing base group and then optionally specify 
a group template. The group template is used to automatically create a new group if needed.
So for example, if your base group was: <i>Top/Data</i> and your Group Template was: <i>Ingested/Satellite</i>
then the result group would be:<pre>
<i>Top/Data/Ingested/Satellite</i>
</pre>

The Harvester would create the <i>Ingested</i> and the <i>Satellite</i> groups as needed.

<p>

The name, description and group templates all can contain the following macros.
Note: The different date fields (e.g., create_, from_ and to) refer to
the create date/time, the from data time (which defaults to the create date
unless specified in the pattern) and the to data time.

The dirgroup macro  is the parent directories of the
data file up to but not including the main directory path we are searching under.
For example, if you are looking under a directory called "/data/idd" and that directory held sub-dirs:<pre>
/data/idd/dir1/data1.nc
/data/idd/dir1/dir2/data2.nc
</pre>

Then when ingesting the data1.nc file its dirgroup value would be:
<pre>
dir1
</pre>

When ingesting the data2.nc file its dirgroup value would be:
<pre>
dir1/dir2
</pre>

Another  common  way of defining the group is to use the date macros. For example a group template of the form:<pre>
${from_year}/${from_monthname}/Week ${from_week}
</pre>

Would result in groups like:
<pre>
2009/January/Week 1
2009/January/Week 2
...
2009/March/Week 1
2009/March/Week 2
</pre>



You can also name the entrys using the macros. So, using the above date based group template you could then have a Name template that incorporates the formatted date:<pre>
Gridded data - ${from_date}
</pre>






<p>
The <i>Move file to storage<i> checkbox allows you to determine whether the file is to be moved from its initial location
to the RAMADDA storage area.
<br>
<b>Note: If the file is not moved to the storage area than one of the data directories the file lies under needs to be added
to the list of file system directories in the Admin-&gt;Access area</b>





<subhead  id="web"  intoc="false">Web Harvesters</subhead>
The Web Harvesters work the same way as the File Harvesters but they fetch a URL (e.g., an image) every time they
run. You can also define more that one URLS to fetch . The basic Run settings, Group and entry creation mechanisms
are the same as described above.
