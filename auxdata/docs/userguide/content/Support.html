If you are having problems installing or using the IDV, or want to

The first source of support is this IDV User's Guide. It contains       
complete instructions for downloading, installing, running, and using   
the IDV reference application and all its features. The User's Guide    
can be accessed from the IDV [ug::menu Help {User's Guide}] menu or     
online at:<p>

<p>&quot;<b>idvdevelopers</b>&quot; is a discussion email list for IDV         
developers who are using IDV source code to build customized or

subscribers to this list and may be able to help with questions about   
use of the IDV software framework.
