<div class="overview">
Real-time Level III radar data is available from the network
of ADDE servers in the Unidata community.  At present, the IDV
can only read Level III data from these servers.
</div>

<p>In this exercise we'll display the Level III radar images
for the super cell area that we loaded in the previous exercise.

<ol class="step">
  <li>Open a new [ht::dialog View Window] 
      by selecting the 
      [ht::menu File New {View Window} {Map Display} {One Pane}] menu.
      By default, the IDV will load data into the currently 
      selected [ht::dialog View Window].
      Minimize the other window with the satellite image in it for now.
  </li>

  <li>[ht::openDataSourceChooser]. 
      Click on the [ht::command Radar] tab,
      then the [ht::command Level III] tab.</li>

  <li>We'll load in Level III Data from the Bow Echo Case Study.
      In the [ht::command Server:] selector, choose
      [ht::param adde.ucar.edu].  
      In the [ht::command Dataset:] selector, choose
      [ht::param CCS039R].  If either of these is
      not in the list, just type them in.  When you have made 
      your selections, click the [ht::button Connect]
      button.</li>

  <li>The IDV connects to the specified server and retrieves 
      the types of radar data available in the dataset and the
      stations for which those data are available.  On the station
      map, you will see <b>DVN</b> which is Davenport, Iowa.  Click
      on this label to select it.

  <li>Using the [ht::command Radar Data Type:] selector, choose
      the [ht::param Base Reflectivity Tilt 1] type.</li>

  <li>For this exercise, we want to select a subset of all available times, 
      so click on the [ht::command Absolute times] radio 
      button.  With this option selected, the server is queried for a set of
      available times for that type and these are listed in the
      [ht::command Times:] panel. Select
      the 11 images from [ht::param 1998-06-29 21:00:00Z]
      through [ht::param 1998-06-29 21:59:00Z].
      Be sure the [ht::command Data Type:]
      is set to [ht::param Reflectivity].  Make sure
      the [ht::command Create display] option is checked, and then
      click the [ht::command Add Source] button.</li>

<!--
  <li>In the [ht::dialog Field Selector] window, 
      you should see [ht::dataset {DVN (Base Reflectivity Tilt 1)}] 
      dataset selected in the [ht::command Data Sources]
      panel, the [ht::param Image Sequence] field 
      selected in the [ht::command Fields] panel,
      and <code class="display">Image Display] selected
      in the [ht::command Displays] panel, and
      the [ht::command Use Default] checkbox
      is selected in the [ht::command Times] 
      panel.  If not, select them, then click the 
      [ht::command Create Display] button.</li>

  <li>Once all the images are loaded, minimize the control window.</li>
-->

  <li>[ht::mapChange]  Turn on the 
      [ht::command North & Central America] maps.
      the [ht::command US Interstate Highways] maps.
      Make sure all other maps are off.  When you are finished,
      go back to the [ht::display View Window].</li>

  <li>Use the [ht::menu Displays Locations US {U.S. Cities}] menu to
      overlay some place names. Change the display to show
      the locations using a custom layout by using
      the display control's [ht::command Layout Model]
      radio button in the control.

  <li>Overlay a radar range ring grid using the
      [ht::menu Displays Special {Range Rings}] menu.</li>

  <li>Start the animation.  In this loop, you will see the bow echo
      move through the area.  Restore the other view window from
      its minimized state.  Notice that as the radar image loops
      through its steps, the corresponding satellite image is
      show in the other window. By default, animation steps are
      shared between views.</li>

  <li>Stop the animation in the radar loop window.  Now start the
      animation in the satellite image display.  Notice this time,
      that the satellite display controls the images that are shown
      in the radar display.</li>

  <li>Open the [ht::dialog Time Animation Properties] dialog
      in the satellite view window.
      <popup label="">
      Click the information icon in the [ht::command {Time Animation Widget}]
      toolbar.
      </popup>
      Change the [ht::command Share Times] option to [ht::command None]
      and click the [ht::command OK] button.
      </li>
   
   <li>Now start the animation in the satellite display and notice that
       the two views animate independently.</li>

   <li>Stop the animation in both windows.</li>

   <li>Close the window you were viewing the satellite data in by
       clicking the [ht::button X] in the upper
       right corner of the window.</li>
