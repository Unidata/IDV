<faqitem cxat="Logins and User Account" q="I forgot my user id. How do I retrieve it?" >
If your RAMADDA site has been configured to send email (see <a href="#email">here</a> to configure email)
then on the Login page you should see &quot;Forget your User ID?&quot; and
&quot;Forget your Password?&quot; links. 
</faqitem>


<faqitem id="checkbox" q="How do I select multiple checkboxes at once?">
In RAMADDA when there is a collection of checkboxes in a form (e.g., in the entry list or in the edit metadata form)
selecting one and then
selecting another with a Shift-Click toggles the range of checkboxes between the first the second
checkbox clicked. Doing a Control-Click on a checkbox toggles all of them on or off.

<faqitem cxat="Administration" id="ssl" q="How do I configure SSL access to RAMADDA?" >
RAMADDA itself does not implement SSL, that is up to the web server container (e.g., Tomcat).
However, once you have SSL enabled you can configure RAMADDA to use  SSL for the connections
that require it (e.g., login, user settings, admin area).
On the main Site Administration  page under the &quot;Contact&quot; area you can specify
the SSL port number on your server. When RAMADDA is configured to use SSL the login form
and the site administration pages will automatically use SSL.

<faqitem id="fixssl" q="Oops, I told RAMADDA to use an SSL port and SSL is not working. Now I cannot access the admin page to turn off SSL and I'm stuck. What can I do?" >
If you logged in as an administrator then on a URL request add the URL argument:<pre>
ramadda.ssl.ignore=true
e.g.:
http://yourserver:8080/repository/admin/settings?ramadda.ssl.ignore=true
</pre>
This temporarily blocks the automatic redirect to the SSL port. You should then go to the Admin Settings
pages and clear the SSL port (or configure SSL in your servlet container).

<p>
If you cannot login as an administrator then you can run RAMADDA with the command line argument:
<pre>-Dramadda.ssl.ignore=true</pre>
Alternatively you can put the following in the repository.properties file:
<pre>override.ramadda.ssl.ignore=true</pre>
The &quot;override.&quot; prefix tells RAMADDA to override the database properties and instead use the property defined in the properties file.
</faqitem>

<faqitem q="I forgot the administrator password and cannot access RAMADDA. How do I login?" >
You can specify an administrator user id and password from the command line when starting RAMADDA.
If you are running RAMADDA stand alone then just provide the arguments:<pre>
-admin &lt;user id&gt; &lt;password&gt;
</pre>
This creates a new user id if needed and sets the password.
<p>
If you are running RAMADDA under Tomcat then change the web.xml to pass in command line arguments
using the &quot;args&quot; entry. This is a comma separated value list of the command line arguments
that are processed by RAMADDA.
<pre>
    &lt;param-name&gt;args&lt;/param-name&gt;
    &lt;param-value&gt;-admin,userid,password&lt;/param-value&gt;
</pre>

<p>
You can also set a username/password  in the repository.properties file in the RAMADDA home directory. Just add:<pre>
ramadda.admin=userid:password
</pre>
and then restart RAMADDA. This sets the password for the given userid.
Note: you should remove this entry once you have reset your password.
</faqitem>



<faqitem id="email" q="How do I configure RAMADDA to send email?" >
RAMADDA can send email for both the password reset process and for monitoring new entries.
On the main Site Administration  page under the &quot;Contact&quot; area you can specify
a SMTP server that RAMADDA will use to send email.
