<div class="overview">
The IDV provides access to Web Map Servers (WMS).
</div>

<ol class="step">
<li> Start fresh by clearing all displays and data [ht::refresh]
and going to a CONUS projection.

<li> [ht::backgroundImage]

<li> The WMS display allows you to save off the displayed image
in either IDV's ximg format or Google Earth's kml/kmz format.
<ul>
<li> From the WMS display's [ht::menu File Save] menu choose 
[ht::menu {Save As Image XML/KML File...}].
<li> Enter [ht::filename bluemarble.ximg].
<li> Now, from the Files data source chooser press [ht::button Update]
and select [ht::filename bluemarble.ximg].
<li> Create a 3 Color (RGB) Image.
<li> Toggle visibility of the displays.
<li> Remove this display.
</ul>



<li> Let's look at a Topographic map.
<ul>
<li> Change the Layer in the WMS display to Topographic Map

<li> Note that all we get is a white background. This is because the 
size of the view is too large and the WMS we are accessing just returns
a white image.


<li> Zoom in over Colorado [ht::zoom]. 

<li> Note that the WMS Control automatically fetches a new image when the view changes.
This can be turned off with the [ht::button Auto-Reload] button.

<li> Keep zooming. What happens? The screen went blank. This is because we
just zoomed through the surface of the earth.

<li> We can fix this by changing the projection. Choose the
[ht::menu Projections Set {Use Displayed Area}] menu item.


</ul>


<li> Let's find out how far it is to walk to the cafeteria in FL2


<ul>
<li> Change the [ht::command Layer] to [ht::command Urban Area]
<li> First we need to find our building. [ht::menu View] menu on the
display control window select [ht::menu {Go to Address}].
Note: you can also do this from the [ht::menu Projections] menu in
the main view window.

<li> Enter our building's address:
<pre>
3300 Mitchell Lane, Boulder, CO
</pre>

<li> Press [ht::button OK]

<li> We should now be looking at FL4. Move the display so FL4 
(control key/right mouse drag) is in the lower left.

<li> Add a [ht::display Range and Bearing] control with the 
[ht::menu Displays Special {Range and Bearing}] menu.

<li> Move the endpoints to figure the distance.

<li> Lets see how many furlongs it is.
<ul>
<li> From the [ht::display Range and Bearing] [ht::menu Edit] menu  select [ht::menu {Change Display Unit...}].
<li> Enter &quot;furlongs&quot; and press [ht::button OK].
</ul>


</ul>

<li> Now, go try to find your home. The [ht::command Go to Address]
dialog can take addresses, zip codes, city/state names or lat/lon points. Mousing over the [ht::button Address] field will show a tooltip
with the different formats available.
