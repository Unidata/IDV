[ht::head {Editing Entries and Metadata}]

<%nochildlist%>

Once an entry is created you can edit its name, description, time range
and lat/lon bounding box with the Edit Entry link in the Edit menu:<br>
[ht::cimg images/editmenu.gif {} {border=0}]
<p>

Which takes you to the Entry Edit form:

[ht::cimg images/editform.gif {Entry Edit Form} {border=0 width=600}]


<p>
If the description of an entry begins with &quot;<wiki>&quot;
then RAMADDA uses the description text as a wiki page
when displaying the entry in the default HTML view.
See <a href="wiki.html">here</a> for  more information
on wiki text in RAMADDA.




<subhead intoc="false" id="metadata">Adding Metadata</subhead>
In RAMADDA entries have some basic metadata that can be edited in
the edit form, e.g., name, description, lat/lon bounding box, time range, etc.
One can also add any number of other metadata elements to an entry.
<p>
Clicking on the &quot;Edit Menu -&gt; Add Metadata&quot; link takes you to the
Add Metadata form where you can select the type of metadata to add.
e.g., Tag:

[ht::cimg images/addmetadata1.gif {Add Metadata Form} {border=0 width=600}]


Select the type of metadata to add, e.g.,  &quot;Tag&quot;:
[ht::cimg images/addmetadata2.gif {Add Tag Metadata Form} {border=0 width=600}]



You can upload a file as an attachment to an entry:
[ht::cimg images/addthumbnail.gif {Add Thumbnail} {border=0 width=600}]

If you create a &quot;thumbnail&quot; attachment that is an image it will be displayed 
when  the entry is listed:
[ht::cimg images/thumbnails.gif {Thumbnail Images} {border=0 width=600}]

Clicking on a thumbnail image will display the full size image:
[ht::cimg images/thumbnailexpanded.gif {Expanded Thumbnail} {border=0 width=600}]



<subhead intoc="false" id="editmetadata">Editing Metadata</subhead>
Selecting the &quot;Edit -&gt; Edit Metadata&quot; menu link allows you to edit and delete the metadata
elements of an entry:

[ht::cimg images/editmetadata.gif {Edit Metadata} {border=0 width=600}]

You can change any of the values of the metadata and press &quot;Change&quot; or
you can select one or more metadata elements and delete them.

<p>
Note: In RAMADDA when there is a collection of checkboxes in a form selecting one and then
selecting another with a Shift-Click toggles the range of checkboxes between the first the second
checkbox clicked. Doing a Control-Click on a checkbox toggles all of them on or off.
<p>
The &quot;Add select to parent group&quot; button allows you to select some metadata elements and copy
them into the parent group. For example, you may have a large number of data files one or more of which
have metadata (see <a href="#autometadata">Automatic Metadata Harvesting</a> for more information).
Instead of laboriously adding metadata to the parent group you can just copy it from one of the 
children data entries.


<subhead intoc="false" id="autometadata">Automatic Metadata Harvesting</subhead>
If there is a data file that RAMADDA can open using the NetCDF/CDM library (e.g., gridded data, point data,
radar, etc.) then there will be a &quot;CDL&quot; view link in the View menu for that entry. On that page
there will be a &quot;Add short metadata&quot; and &quot;Add full metadata&quot; links shown.
Adding  short metadata will just try to determine the geospatial bounds and the time range of
the data file and set those properties. Adding full metadata will also add as metadata elements
the netcdf varbiables and all of the netcdf global attributes found.
