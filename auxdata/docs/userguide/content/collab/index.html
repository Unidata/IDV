The IDV provides a real-time, multi-user collaboration facility. This   
facility supports a variety of styles of interaction including ad-hoc   
peer-to-peer and multiple clients/one server.                           

<p>

To begin a collaborative session with another user bring up             
the collaboration control user interface through the 
[ug::menu Collaboration {Show Window}] menu. You will see:

The user interface allows you to:

<%childlist%>


<subhead id="connect">Create and Listen for Connections</subhead>

The first thing you need to do is either connect to another IDV running 
on another machine or to start up a server on your IDV to accept        
connections from other users. To start up a server simply press the     
[ht::command {Start server}] button. This starts up a server that        
will listen for incoming requests for connections. When another user    
tries to connect to your IDV a dialog window will be shown that asks    
whether you want to accept the connection. Clicking on the 
[ht::command Accept new connections without asking] checkbox will 
have the IDV automatically accept connections.                                       

<p>
You can connect to other users by entering their machine hostname into the given
text field and clicking on the [ht::command {Connect to:}] button.



<subhead id="clients">Viewing and Controlling Connections</subhead>

The [ht::command Clients] tab shows the list of other users who you are 
currently connected to. This tab also allows you to choose whether your 
IDV should send its changes to others, whether to receive changes from  
others and whether to relay changes from one of the IDVs that you are   
connected to on to other connected IDVs. In the [ht::command Clients] list 
you can also have finer granularity over who shares what.

<subhead id="chat">Text Chat</subhead>

The collaboration facility also supports text chat among connected      
users. This interface is under the [ht::command Chat] tab. 
[ht::cimg images/Chat.gif {Chat Window}] 
Simply type in the message in the given  
text field and click on the [ht::command Send] button.                  

<subhead id="log">Log Display</subhead>

The [ht::command Log] tab shows a log of the activities of a
collaborative session.
