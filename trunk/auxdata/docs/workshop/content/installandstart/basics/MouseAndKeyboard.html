<div class="overview">
This page summarizes use of the mouse and keyboard for 
controlling IDV displays using the default mouse and keyboard
assignments.  You can change the default behavior through
the [ht::command Navigation] tab of the User Preferences accessed
by the [ht::menu Edit Preferences] menu.

<p> "Click" the mouse means to press and release a mouse button once.</p>

<p> "Double-click" means to click a mouse button twice quickly.</p>

<p> "Drag" means to press and hold down a mouse button, 
move the mouse and then release the mouse button. </p>

<p> All references to mouse buttons are in respect to a 3-button 
right-handed mouse: </p>

<ul>
  <li><b>MB1</b> (mouse button 1) is the <b>left</b> button. </li>
  <li><b>MB2</b> (mouse button 2) is the <b>middle</b> button. </li>
  <li><b>MB3</b> (mouse button 3) is the <b>right</b> button. </li>
</ul>

If you are using a left-handed mouse, MB1 is the right button and
MB3 is the left-button.<p>

If you are using a Mac with a single button mouse, MB3 is simulated
using the <b>Option</b>+click combination.  Not all functions listed
below (e.g., panning) work with this combination on a one button mouse.</p>

This table summarizes the operations you can perform with the mouse:

<a name="zoom"></a>
<div class="pagesubtitle">Zoom, Pan, and Rotate</div>

There are several methods to zoom, pan, and rotate in the IDV. You
can use the mouse, the arrow keys, a rubber band box, or the Zoom/Pan
Toolbar.

<a name="rubberband"></a>
<div class="pagesubtitle">Rubber Band Box to zoom in</div>

You can zoom into an area by outlining it with a "rubber band box."
Hold down the <b>Shift</b> key, then drag the left mouse button (MB1)
to outline a box. The outline appears while you are dragging the mouse,
before the zoom. If the display was significantly rotated before using
the rubber band box, the new display may have the data area off screen;
zoom out to find it, or use <b>Ctrl-r</b> key combination to reset to
the initial overhead viewpoint.


<a name="mousezoom"></a>
<div class="pagesubtitle">Mouse controls to Zoom, Pan, and Rotate</div>

You can zoom, rotate, and pan using the right mouse button (MB3). 

<ul class="step">


  <li>To <b>zoom</b> a 3D display hold down the Shift key and drag the right
      mouse button (MB3). Moving the mouse forward zooms in; moving the mouse
      backward zooms out. This method allows any amount of zooming and
      precise control.</li>

  <li>To <b>pan</b> a 3D display hold down the Ctrl key and drag the right
      mouse button (MB3) in the direction you want to move the display. 
      This method allows the most precise control over how much panning 
      occurs and allows panning in any direction.</li>

  <li>To <b>rotate</b> a 3D display in any direction, drag the mouse with
      right button down over the display. Rotating the display with the
      mouse takes some getting used to. </li>

</ul>

<a name="keyzoom"></a>
<div class="pagesubtitle">Keyboard controls to Zoom, Pan, and Rotate</div>

You can zoom, rotate, and pan using the arrow keys on the keyboard. 
You must first click the mouse in the view window.

<ul class="step">

  <li>You can <b>zoom</b> by holding the <b>Shift</b> key and pressing
      the up (zoom in) and down (zoom out) arrows on the keyboard.</li>
            
  <li>You can <b>pan</b> the display by holding the <b>Ctrl</b> key and
      pressing the arrow keys on the keyboard.  Using the method,
      the display will pan in the direction of the arrow.</li>

  <li>You can <b>rotate</b> the 3D display using the arrow keys on
      the keyboard.  Click in the window and use
      the arrow keys to rotate the 3-D box.</li>

  <li>Use the key combination <b>Ctrl-r</b> to reset the display to 
      the initial view of this projection (overhead, centered on center 
      of the map projection in use).</li>

</ul>

<p>

<a name="listselect">
<div class="pagesubtitle">List selection</div>

The IDV uses the standard methods for selecting multiple items
in a list (e.g., times list).  These are:

<ul class="step">

  <li><b>To select everything in the list:</b>:
          
    <ul class="substep">

      <li>Click on the list to activate it.</li>

      <li>Press <b>Ctrl-a</b>.

    </ul>
  </li>

  <li><b>To select a continuous range</b>:

    <ul class="substep">

      <li>Click on one item in the list to start the range.</li>

      <li>Hold the <b>Shift</b> key down and click on the last
          item in the range.  All items between the first
          and last are selected.</li>

    </ul>
  </li>

  <li><b>To select a non-continuous range</b>:
          
    <ul class="substep">

      <li>Click on one item in the list.</li>

      <li>Hold the <b>Ctrl</b> key<b>**</b> down and click on other items
          in the list.  As each item is clicked, it is highlighted
          to indicate that it is selected.</li>

      <li>To unselected an item, hold the <b>Ctrl</b> key<b>**</b> down and
          click on the item.</li><p>

      <b>**</b>On the Apple Mac, use the <b>Command</b> key instead of 
               <b>Ctrl</b>

    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<div class="pagesubtitle">Toggling Visibility of Displays</div>

There are several ways to toggle visibility of displays.

<ol class="step">
  <li>When using the side legends, the 
      [ht::command {Display Visibility}] checkbox to the left
      of the label can be used to toggle the visibility of that display.
      When using the bottom legend, click on the legend label to 
      toggle visibility of that one display.<p>

  <li>The padlock icon <img src="images/unlock.gif"> on the right side of the 
      [ht::command {legend bar}] is a toggle to lock visibility. 
      Click on the padlock icon to toggle locking. When locked, the icon
      will look like this. <img src="images/lock.gif">. This lock overrides 
      most other actions which might change visibility, including 
      using the keyboard number keys. Use this to lock one or more 
      displays' visibility on or off while you change visibility of other 
      displays. You can still toggle visibility of a 
      locked display with a click on the legend label.</li><p>

  <li>The function keys <code class="command">F1, F2, F3</code> can
      be used to cycle visibility as follows:

      <ul>

        <li>The [ht::command {F1}] key cycles visibility through 
            all non-locked displays, showing one at a time.</li>

        <li>The [ht::command {F2}] turns on all non-locked 
            displays.</li>

        <li>The [ht::command {F3}] turns off all non-locked 
            displays.</li>

      </ul>
   </li><p>


   <li>Use the [ht::menu View Visible] checkbox
       menu item in each display control's menu.</li><p>

</ol>
