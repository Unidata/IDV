The [ug::chooser Radar] chooser contains three sub-tabs that allow you to choose
NEXRAD Level III data on remote ADDE servers or NEXRAD Level II/III data from your file system or a remote THREDDS Data Server (TDS).

The [ug::chooser Level III] chooser  works similarly to the Image chooser described above:
<ol>

[ug::step "Choose an ADDE [ug::menu Server] and a [ug::menu Dataset] to use:" images/RadarStep1.gif]

[ug::step "Press [ug::button Connect]:" images/RadarStep2.gif {This causes  the IDV to query 
the server for available radar types and stations.}]

[ug::step {Select a station using the map:} {images/RadarStep3.gif} ]

[ug::step {Select a radar type:} images/RadarStep4.gif {Once a station and a radar type has been selected the ADDE server will be queried
as to the available times.
Optionally, you can override the default data type that is returned.
}]


[ug::step {Or, choose a set of absolute times (e.g., 12Z, 1Z):} images/ImageStep5.gif {
When choosing 
absolute times for the first time the IDV needs to query the ADDE server 
for the times.  Times can be selected in the list or the time line
(use control/click or shift/click in the list to select multiple times).
See the <a href="../../tools/Timeline.html">Timeline section</a> for details on its use.
}]


[ug::step "When done, load the selected radar data with the [ug::button Add Source] button."]

</ol>
