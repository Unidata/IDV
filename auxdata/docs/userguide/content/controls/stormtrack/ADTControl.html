{Advanced Dvorak Technique Control}

<%nochildlist%>

The Advanced Dvorak Technique (ADT) utilizes longwave-infrared, temperature measurements
from geostationary satellites to estimate tropical cyclone (TC) intensity. More information
about the ADT and various run-time options, algorithms, and program outputs can be found in
the McIDAS-X ADT-Version 8.2.1 Users' Guide at the
<a href="http://tropic.ssec.wisc.edu/misc/adt/info.html">Advanced Dvorak Technique (ADT)</a>

<li>First select and display a geostationary satellite longwave-infrared imagerys.</li>

<li>Second select "Temperature" calibration of the same longwave-infrared band and select
    Advanced Dvorak Technique (Under Development) display type and click Create Display. </li>

<li>The GUI to control the ADT will then be displayed in the "Displays" tab of the Dashboard. </li>

<li>Perform ADT analysis on the image:  If it is the Manual option (default), left-click and drag
    the probe in the Main Display window to select the storm center and click on the blue
    [ug::button Run Analysis] button at the bottom of the screen of the ADT control. Once the
    analysis has completed a popup window will appear containing the ADT Analysis Bulletin output</li>

<p>
    The ADT is still experimental and may have bugs that have not been found and we are
    keep working on the development of the connection of the automated storm selection with the
    National Hurricane Center online ATCF Best Track files.

    {{Storm Center Selection} {
    If the Manual option (default) is utilized, the storm position is selected manually by the user
    in the Display Window. A colored dot will mark the storm position selected, with the corresponding
    position displayed in the ADT GUI window in the Latitude and Longitude text boxes in the "Manual
    Storm Selection" section. To select the storm center, left-click and drag the probe in the Main Display
    window.
    }}

    {{History File Information} {
    There are several operations on an existing ADT History file. To initiate, first select a
    history file in the "History File Information" section by clicking on the "Select History File"
    button and choosing a history file. Once a history file is chosen, press the "List/Write History File"
    button at the bottom of the "Layer Controls" tab. A new popup window will be displayed containing
    the history file listing of the selected history file along with two buttons at the bottom of
    the window.
    }}

    {{PMW Analysis} {
    To initiate the "PMW Analysis" section, click on the "Activate" checkbox. The "Manual" entry option
    button will be activated along with the three text entry boxes corresponding to the PMW overpass Date,
    Time, and Eye Score values. Please note that you MUST press "Enter" on the keyboard after entering
    input into each text window! The "Automated" option will be grayed out since this option is not
    available in this version of the McV-ADT, as mentioned above. Also note that the use of the PMW
    Analysis is only available when utilizing an ADT History file.

    {{Miscellaneous Options:} {
    <ul>
    <li>The [ug::button MSLP Conversion Method] defines the methodology used to convert the CI#/Wind Speed value to
    mean sea level pressure. The "Dvorak" option (default) will utilize the historical Atlantic or West Pacific
    conversions. The "CKZ" option will use the "Courtney/Knaff/Zehr" conversion, which requires two input
    parameters to be supplied to the conversion equations; Environmental MSLP (Penv) and the 34-knot
    wind/Gale radius (34kt Radius).</li>

    <li>The [ug::button Land Flag] allows the ADT to operate over land if the "OFF" radio button is selected (default selection
    is "ON", which will keep the land flag activated and forbid ADT analysis when the storm center is over a
    significant land feature).</li>

    <li>The [ug::button ACTF Output] allows the user to write an ATCF formatted intensity record to an output file (location
    defined with the ODTOUTPUT variable in the adtenv file). The name of the file is automatically
    determined and is based upon the image date and time along with two manually input variables.</li>
    </ul>
