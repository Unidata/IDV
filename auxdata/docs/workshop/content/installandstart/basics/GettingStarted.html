<div class="overview">
In this section, we will examine some of the Graphical User Interface 
(GUI) features of the IDV.  
</div>

<p>The sections below describe the user interface of the main window of
the IDV reference application. 
First, we'll load in a time sequence of data so we can 
use some of the menus and widgets in the IDV's GUI and see their effect.

<ul>
<li>From the [ht::menu "Favorites Toolbar"], select the
[ht::menu "<%starting.bundle%>"] item from the
[ht::menu "Workshop"] menu.

<li>When the dialog pops up asking you how you want to load the bundle,
click the [ht::command OK] button.
</ul>

We'll explore the Favorite Bundle mechanism in a later exercise.

<h1>View Window</h1>

The <code class="dialog">View Window</code> is where
the visualizations of the loaded data are displayed.  You can have
several of these windows as we'll see in a later exercise.

<h1>Dashboard</h1>

The <code class="dialog">Dashboard</code> window holds many of
the non "View" windows.  It provides a holder for the data choosers,
field selector and the display controls as well as quick access
to some handy IDV features.

Notice that the <code class="dialog">Dashboard</code> and
<code class="dialog">View</code> windows have 
identical menu bars.  This allows you to control the IDV from
either window.
<p>
Now let's learn how to navigate around the 3D main window.</li>
