<body>
The Transect View is a 2-Dimensional display that shows
data along a transect line.  This type of
view can be created through the [ug::menu File New {View Window}] menu.

[ht::cimg images/TransectViewManager1.gif -caption {Transect View}] 



The left vertical axis shows altitude in meters, the right axis shows
pressure levels.  The horizontal axis shows distance along the transect.
You can zoom and pan in this display with the normal key and mouse 
combinations.
<p>
The transect line  that is being used in this view can be displayed or changed
through the [ug::menu Transects Edit] menu. This creates a 
<a href="../controls/misc/TransectDrawingControl.html">Transect Drawing Control</a>
that is shown in another Map View.
The Transect Drawing Control allows you to create or modify transect lines.
Note, when you change a transect line the Transect View is automatically
changed.
You can also select any of the pre-defined or user created transects
from the [ug::menu Transects] menu as well.
<p>

In the [ug::button Transects] tab of the [ug::button Properties] 
dialog for the Transect View (from [ug::menu View Properties])
you can define a maximum distance to show. Normally, data that
lies with the bounding lines that are orthogonal to the transect
line is shown in this display. The max distance gives a display radius. 
Data that lies past this max distance is not displayed.
