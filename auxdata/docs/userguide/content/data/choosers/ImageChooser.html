The  [ug::chooser Images] chooser allows you to access 
satellite imagery on remote ADDE servers.  

[ht::cimg images/ImageChooser.gif {Image Chooser}]

To select images:

<ol>

[ug::step "Choose an ADDE [ug::menu Server] and a [ug::menu Dataset] to use. Press [ug::button Connect] to query the server for available image types" images/ImageStep1.gif {The IDV comes pre-configured with a list of ADDE servers and data sets or you can enter
your own. See  <a href="DataSources.html">Available data</a> for a description
of these pre-defined data sets.}]


[ug::step "Select the [ug::menu {Image Type}] to use:" images/ImageStep3.gif]

[ug::step {You may choose a relative set of times steps (e.g., Last 5 times):} images/ImageStep4.gif]

[ug::step {Or, choose a set of absolute times (e.g., 12Z, 1Z):} images/ImageStep5.gif {
When choosing 
absolute times for the first time the IDV needs to query the ADDE server 
for the times. This may take some time.  
Times can be selected in the list or the time line
(use control/click or shift/click in the list to select multiple times).
See the <a href="../../tools/Timeline.html">Timeline section</a> for details on its use.
}]

[ug::step {Or, match the times of the current active display window:} images/MatchTimeDriver.gif {
This assumes the current active display window has a display with the time driver set. A  
display can be set as a time driver in the <a href="../FieldSelector.html#TimeMatchingFS">Time Subset panel</a>
in the Field Selector tab or the <a href="../../controls/index.html#DisplayControlViewMenu">
View</a> menu in the Dashbaord's Displays tab.
}]

[ug::step {Select the navigation type:} images/NavType.gif {
This widget is enable when the image type from the ADDE server is polar orbit data and its default
value is latlon.
}]

[ug::step {Optionally override the image selection properties
(e.g., image size, location, etc.) See below for more details.}]

[ug::step "When done, load the selected image data with the [ug::button Add Source] button."]
