<faqitem  id="j8282" q="OpenJDK Java Version">

  <p>
    Due to the end of Oracle Java free release updates, the IDV project has
    officially moved from Oracle JDK to OpenJDK packages that receives support via the
    community. The AdoptOpenJDK provides prebuilt binaries from OpenJDK class libraries. All AdoptOpenJDK
    binaries and scripts are open source licensed and available for free. The version of the
    AdoptOpenJDK distributed with the IDV is 1.8.0_282. See
    the <a href=https://adoptopenjdk.net/> adoptOpenJDK Library</a> for a more details information.

<faqitem q="Latest netCDF-Java Version" id="nj465">

  <p>
    The version of the netCDF-Java library currently distributed with the IDV is
    the 5.4.2.  See
    the <a href="https://github.com/Unidata/netcdf-java/releases/tag/v5.4.2">
      netCDF-Java Library</a> for a more details information.

<faqitem id="darkmode" q="IDV Appearance Mode">

  <p>
    In macOS and Linux users can choose to adopt a light, dark, or IDV regular appearance. The dark appearance,
    known as Dark Mode, implements an interface style that many apps already adopt. Users can edit the user
    preference and can choose their interface appearance mode based on ambient lighting conditions.

<faqitem id="ProbSevere" q="ProbSevere Statistical Model Display" >
  <p>
    The IDV has developed a new data source type to create a time series display of the ProbSevere Statistical
    models output that provide probabilistic guidance to forecasters on the likelihood of severe weather
    occurrence for convection in the near term. Algorithms of ProbSevere incorporate multiple datasets
    from satellite, radar, total lightning, and NWP into easy-to interpret products. With a direct connection
    to the NCEP ProbSevere web page to retrieve data of the last 24 hours and the time matching feature
    of the IDV, it is  very easy to integrate ProbSevere model data with other data source types and
    to assist forecasters in severe weather situations.

<faqitem id="ADT" q="ADT Integration and Development">
  <p>
    The Advanced Dvorak Technique (ADT) utilizes longwave-infrared, temperature measurements from geostationary
    satellites to estimate tropical cyclone (TC) intensity. The Dvorak Technique continues to be the standard
    method for estimating TC intensity. The ADT is still experimental and we are working on the integration and
    enhancement of the ADT functionalities for the IDV community.

<faqitem id="texthtmldisplay" q="Text Html Display">
  <p>
    New enhanced Text/Html display avaiable under Displays > Special for displaying straight text or HTML, the display
    can be added to the view window legend panel for descriptive text about the display.
  </p>
</faqitem>

<faqitem id="displayimagequality" q="Image Capture Quality">
  <p>
    When doing the image capture we replaced the original screen capture APIs with Java Canvas3D “OffScreenRendering”
    to improve the image quality. Keep Java Robot screen capture APIs only when the IDV legend and Full window is needed.
    Replaced JPEG with PNG as the base image format for the animated movie.

<faqitem id="wrfformulas" q="WRF NetCDF Formulas">
  <p>
    The original WRF netCDF output is in sigma coordinate. The current grid diagnostic formulas are mostly
    designed for the isobaric surface parameters. The newly added WRF derived formulas provide functions
    to directly create the derived parameters such as: Equivalent potential temperature, relative humidity,
    Saturated Equivalent potential temperature, dewpoint, and others.

<faqitem q="Bug Fixes" id="bugfix">
  We fixed a bug associated with the excessive data loading in this release. Another
  bug fixed is to handle the redirect of the http urls.
