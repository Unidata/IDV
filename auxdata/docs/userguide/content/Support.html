If you are having problems installing or using the IDV, or want to
know how to perform a particular task, you have several resources
to help you out.

is available for the IDV">IDV Documentation</subhead>

complete instructions for downloading, installing, running, and using   
the IDV reference application and all its features. The User's Guide can
be accessed from the IDV 
[ug::menu Help {User's Guide}] menu or online at:<p>

<p>&quot;<b>idvusers</b>&quot; is a list for all IDV users. The intended

reference application, downloading and running the IDV, data sources    
and formats for use in the IDV, and sharing of IDV based materials      
(bundles, educational materials, etc). This list is used by the Unidata 
Program Center to announce new releases of the IDV.                     

<p>&quot;<b>idvdevelopers</b>&quot; is a discussion email list for IDV         
developers who are using IDV source code to build customized or         
new IDV-based applications. The software developers of the IDV are      
subscribers to this list and may be able to help with questions about   
use of the IDV software framework.
