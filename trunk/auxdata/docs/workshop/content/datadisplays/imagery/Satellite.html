<title>Loading Satellite Imagery</title>

<div class="overview">
Satellite imagery from geostationary and polar orbiting satellites
is available through a network of servers supported by Unidata.
Most of the imagery available on these servers covers the 
North America region.  These servers use the Abstract Data
Distribution Environment (ADDE) protocol.
</div>

<p>First, we'll load in some visible imagery from the Bow Echo
Case Study that we used in the <b>Gridded Data</b> section of
the workshop.</p>

<ol class="step">
  <li>[ht::clearDisplaysAndData]</li>

  <li>[ht::openDataSourceChooser] 
      Click on the [ht::command Images] tab.</li>

  <li>We'll load in some visible satellite imagery.
      In the [ht::command Server:] selector, choose
      [ht::param adde.ucar.edu].  
      In the [ht::command Dataset:] selector, choose
      [ht::param CCS039].  If either of these is
      not in the list, just type them in.  When you have made 
      your selections, click the [ht::button Connect]
      button.</li>

  <li>The IDV connects to the specified server and retrieves 
      the types of images available in the dataset.  From the
      [ht::command Image Type:] selector, choose
      the [ht::param 1 km GOES-8 Visible] type.</li>

  <li>You can either load in the last &quot;<i>n</i>&quot; images, or
      you can select by time.  For this exercise, we want to select
      a subset of all available times, so click on the 
      [ht::command Absolute times] radio button.
      When this option is selected, the server is queried for a set of
      available times for that type and these are listed in the
      [ht::command Times:] panel. Select [ht::listSelect]
      the 7 images from [ht::param 1998-06-29 16:15:00Z]
      through [ht::param 1998-06-29 22:15:00Z].  Be sure that
      the [ht::command Create display] checkbox is selected 
      and click the [ht::button Add Source] button.</li>

<!--
  <li>In the [ht::dialog Field Selector] window, 
      you should see [ht::dataset 1 km GOES-8 Visible]
      dataset selected in the [ht::command Data Sources]
      panel, the [ht::param 0.65 um Visible - Cloud Cover] field 
      selected in the [ht::command Fields] panel,
      and [ht::display Image Display] selected
      in the [ht::command Displays] panel, and
      [ht::command Use Default] checked
      in the [ht::command Times] panel.  If not, 
      select them, then click the 
      [ht::command Create Display] button.</li>
-->

  <li>[ht::mapChange]  Turn on the 
      [ht::command North & Central America] and
      the [ht::command US Interstate Highways] maps.
      Make sure all other maps are off.  When you are finished,
      go back to the [ht::dialog View Window].</li>

  <li>Use the [ht::menu Displays Locations US {U.S. Cities}] menu to
      overlay some place names. Change the color of the location
      text to be white using the display control's 
      [ht::menu Edit Color] menu.

  <li>Start the animation.  In this loop, you will see a large
      super cell thunderstorm develop over Iowa during this period.
      Stop the animation and show the 20:15Z image.</li>

  <li>Zoom in over the super cell in eastern Iowa</li>

  [ht::cimg images/VisImage.gif]

  <li>This is visible imagery at 1 kilometer resolution.  You can
      use the [ht::command Pixel Sampling] slider
      to see what the image would look like at a lower resolution.
      <ul class="substep">
        <li>Move the slider to <b>5</b> to see the difference 
            an image at 6 km resolution would look like.</li>

        <li>Return the slider back to <b>0</b> before proceeding to 
            the next exercise.</li>
            
        <li>Do not clear this display.</li>
      </ul>

</ol>
