To make the documentation do:
source make.sh
Or:
tclsh ../../build/generate.tcl -clean

This will generate the documentation and place it in ../processed



To make the pdf file you first need to have htmldoc installed: 
https://www.htmldoc.org/
This is the utility that generates a pdf from a big html file.
With htmldoc installed and in your path you can just do:
source makepdf.sh
This generates one big html file -doall:
tclsh ../../build/generate.tcl -clean

Then cd to ../processed
Then source ../content/genpdf.sh
Which results in a workshop.pdf file


Note: There is a version of htmldoc in:
/upc/share/idv/software
that is compiled to run on harpo and the like
