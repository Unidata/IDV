***********************************************************************
The release environment:

On conan all release oriented directories and files point through the 
symbolic link:

/content/software/idv/current

So we have(in an abbreviated way):                            
/content/software/idv/data  --> current/data
/content/software/idv/docs  --> current/docs
/content/software/idv/webstart/IDV  --> current/webstart/IDV

Run the test suite (see below) and make sure to update and
check in /ucar/unidata/idv/resources/version.properties.

When you are ready to make a release, run:

cd /share/idv/build
./buildIdv release

That will run the build, generate the installers, move all relevant files 
(installers, docs, webstart) to conan.  The following directories will be
created:

/content/software/idv/<release_dir>
/content/downloads/idv/<release_dir>

where <release_dir> is the version number with underscores (e.g. version 2.8 will be
in <release_dir> 2_8).

Then (see below):

  Update the downloads/idv/toc.xml (see below)

  Expand the javadoc (see below).

  Generate the User Guide and Workshop PDFs (see below)

  Update the index.html page (see below).

  branch the SVN repository

  change the /content/software/idv/current to point to the new release.

***********************************************************************
Update the downloads toc.xml page

On conan:

cd /content/downloads/idv
edit the toc.xml
  - change the %version% property value
  - change where the current and previous point to
change the current link to point to the new release.

***********************************************************************
Expand the javadoc

cd /content/software/idv/<release>/docs
jar xvf ~ftp/pub/idv/<release_dir>/idv_javadoc_<version>.jar
cd idv/docs
mv javadoc ../..
cd ../..
rm -rf META-INF/ idv

***********************************************************************
Generate the PDFs

You  need to build the userguide.pdf and workshop.pdf files.
To do this you need to be on harpo (which has the htmldoc executable)
and run:
ant docs_pdf
from /share/idv/ucar
This will generate the userguide.pdf and workshop.pdf and place them in the
docs directory.

Once this is done, copy them to conan:
 
/content/software/idv/<release>/docs/userguide/userguide.pdf
/content/software/idv/<release>/docs/workshop/workshop.pdf

***********************************************************************
Changing the index.html page

cd /content/software/idv/<release_dir> 

cp ../<previous_release_dir>/index.html index.html.<release_dir>

edit the index.html.<version> file and update the IDV News and Announcements
section with information about the new release.

cp index.html.<version> index.html

(If you have to redo the release, index.html will get overwritten.  That's why
we make the edits in index.html.<version>)

Open http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/idv/<release_dir> in a web browser.
Test all the links to the docs.  Fix any broken links.

***********************************************************************
Branch the SVN repository:

After the release of a version, you should make a brand in the SVN repository
in case changes are needed later.  To branch the SVN repository,
run:

svn copy http://sub.unidata.ucar.edu/idv/trunk http://sub.unidata.ucar.edu/idv/branches/IDV_<version>

where <version> is the version (e.g., 2.8).

***********************************************************************
Update the current and stable links:

cd /content/software/idv
rm current
ln -s <current IDV version> current

cd release
rm stable
rm current
ln -s ../<current IDV version> current
ln -s ../<stable IDV version> stable    (or simply point stable to current)

Go to the IDV homepage and make sure it is pointing to the updated directory.  Make 
sure all the links on the page work correctly.

***********************************************************************
Running the test suite

Of course, running the tests should come first but  it comes last in the README
due to its length.

The cliff notes version of this section, i.e., to run the full 
test suite on the results of the build simply:
cd /share/idv/lib
tclsh /share/idv/test/runtest.tcl 

And look at:
/share/idv/lib/results.html
 
It is probably best to do this on harpo since the original archive images
are generated on harpo. This should minimize false differences.


The longer version:

The set of test archives are in:
/share/idv/test/archives
Each archive has a directory there, e.g., dem, elnino, eta1, etc.
The script:
/share/idv/test/runtest.tcl
runs the set of tests. You can give it the full directory name of a 
test archive to run just one test:
tclsh /share/idv/test/runtest.tcl /share/idv/test/archives/eta1
or as a short hand:
tclsh /share/idv/test/runtest.tcl eta1

If no archive directories  are given on the command line it will run through
all of the archives in /share/idv/test/archives

The version of the idv that is used depends on where you are when you 
run the test. If there is an idv.jar in the current working directory
then the script will run:
java -jar idv.jar
else it will run from the classpath:
java ucar.unidata.idv.DefaultIdv


The script will iterate through the test archives. For each on it will run
the idv in test mode and tell the idv to write to the <archive name>_results
directory. The script will then compare the generated images in the
original archive with the generated images in the _results directory.
The script produces 3 output files in the working directory:
   
        results.html  resultsLeft.html  resultsRight.html

Results is a frame set that contains resultsLeft.html and resultsRight.html
Any stderr output is shown in resultsRight.html in red.
resultsLeft.html  highlights the images that differ. 
Note: We just do a "diff image1 image2" on the images. So
it is always the case that we pick up differences between some of the 
images.


To create a test archive enable the "Test" menu. There should be 
a "Write Test Archive" entry. Select that and you will be prompted
for an archive name, an optional text description and the directory
to place the archive in. Select /share/idv/test/archives.

***********************************************************************
Building/configuring the installers

The installers are built automatically by ant using install4j
which is located in /share/install4j.  We have a single,
multi-platform license which means that only one copy can run at
a time, but on any machine you want.  Website for install4j is
http://www.ej-technologies.com/products/install4j/overview.html.
The Unidata Admin staff has the license information.  The license server
runs on zero.

The configuration file is in svn:
/ucar/unidata/idv/release/installer/idv.install4j.  This file is used
as a template for the installer and copied to /share/idv/installers
during the build process.  At that point, the version number is filled in.

To make configuration changes, run /share/install4j/bin/install4j
and open the template.  After making changes, test the build and if it
works as you expect, save the changes back to the template.

JRE bundles:

The JREs that are included in the installers need to be updated
periodically as new versions of Java come out.  On most platforms, it's
a matter of:

- downloading the JRE from java.sun.com
- logging onto a machine of the particular OS
- unpacking the OS specific JRE to the appropriate subdirectory of /share/idv/jre
- installing Java 3D on top of the unpacked JRE (just unzip the version in the directory)
- running install4j to create a new JRE bundles.  (Using install4j creates 
smaller bundles than manually tar'ing and gzipping the JRE directory).

The only platform that is problematic is Windows because when you install
the JRE, it makes it the default on your system.  So, you have to install
it on your system, not to a temporary directory.  You also have to install a
copy of install4j on your system to run the bundle generator.  You can copy the
c:/Program Files/Java/jre6 (or whereever the JRE was installed) over to
/share/idv/windows, unzip the Java 3D on it and then pack it up using the
Windows version of install4j.

To create a JRE bundle in install4j, start it up and select the 
Project->Create a JRE Bundle menu and step through the process. The important
page is the Select a JRE:

- select the top level of the unpacked JRE
- Input the version of the JRE (e.g. 1.6.0_20)
- For the custom id, use the java 3d version  (e.g., j3d1.5.2)

The resulting JRE bundle will use this to create a name like:

linux-i386-1.6.0_20.5.2.tar.gz

The JRE bundles are automatically stored in /share/install4j/jres, except
on Windows.  It will be stored in the jres directory of the Windows install4j
installation and then has to be manually copied over to /share/install4j/jres.

Once you have created the JRE bundles, you need to update the template to point
to the new versions.  There are two ways to do this.  The most fool-proof way is
to run install4j and update the Media instances to point to the new bundles.  The
other is just to edit the template.  If you do the latter, just make sure you change
all references.

SSEC uses install4j for McIDAS-V, so you can contact them for help with the program.
We also share the JRE bundles with them for platforms that we don't have.

The Unidata admin staff has the information on licenses and passwords to get in
to download new versions.
