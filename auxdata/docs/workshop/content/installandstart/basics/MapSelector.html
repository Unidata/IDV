<div class="overview">
This page summarizes use of the map selector that is available in
some of the choosers.
</div>

<p>
Some of the choosers (e.g., Level III radar, profiler, RAOB) use a map
of stations. You can zoom and see more stations with a rubber-band box
made by dragging the left mouse button on the map. Also note the icons
below the map to zoom and pan. Reading from left to right, the plus
icon zooms in, the minus icon zooms out, the curving arrow restores the
previous view, and the house icon restores the original view. The up
arrow moves the view up (map down); the down arrows moves the view down
(map up), the left arrow moves the view left (map right) and the right
arrow moves the view right (map left).</p>

<p>
The Declutter check box allows you to show all stations (not checked),
or only a limited number of stations that do not overlap each other
(checked). You may need to zoom in to see all the stations clearly
separated. TIP: It can be helpful to zoom into an area where you want to
select stations, before clicking on the station, to avoid the chance of
getting a neighbor station by mistake.</p>

<p>
The station map may support selecting either one station (e.g. for radar
data) or multiple stations (e.g., for profiler data). Left clicking on
a station will select it. If in multiple selection mode Shift-drag will
select all stations within a region. Control-drag will add the stations
in the selected region to the set of already selected stations. Pressing
the Control-A key will select all stations. Right clicking in the map
will bring up a menu that allows you to select all stations and to clear
the selection.</p>
