<faqitem  id="j8282" q="OpenJDK Java Version">

  <p>
    Due to the end of Oracle Java free release updates, the IDV project has
    officially moved from Oracle JDK to OpenJDK packages that receives support via the
    community. The AdoptOpenJDK provides prebuilt binaries from OpenJDK class libraries. All AdoptOpenJDK
    binaries and scripts are open source licensed and available for free. The version of the
    AdoptOpenJDK distributed with the IDV is 1.8.0_282. See
    the <a href=https://adoptopenjdk.net/> adoptOpenJDK Library</a> for a more details information.

  <p>
    The version of the netCDF-Java library currently distributed with the IDV is
    the 5.5.3.  See
    the <a href="https://github.com/Unidata/netcdf-java/releases/tag/v5.5.3">

<faqitem id="radargriddisplay" q="Level II Radar Grid Displays">
  <p>
    The new and enhanced feature of the Level 2 radar grid display reads radial parameters from the Level 2
    volume scan dataset and automatically generates 3D Cartesian grid parameters. The Integrated Data Viewer (IDV)
    employs an 8-point weighted interpolation method for this purpose. Efficient search algorithms are utilized to
    identify the 8 potential valid numbers of data points from 4 available surrounding rays. These algorithms
    significantly contribute to expediting the process. The resultant 3D Cartesian grid parameters can be
    showcased through various visualization techniques such as volume rendering, iso-surface representation,
    cross-sectional display, and plan-view presentations.

<faqitem id="pointcloudsngrids" q="Point Clouds and Point Grids" >
  <p>
    The IDV has introduced a novel data source type named "Point Cloud Data" exclusively tailored for CF netCDF
    station time series feature data. This innovation facilitates the presentation of time series point clouds
    and point grids for such point feature data. The IDV's point cloud display effectively visualizes substantial
    quantities of point data (often numbering in the millions) by portraying them as a collection of points,
    each colored based on its corresponding parameter. Additionally, the point grid function adeptly interpolates
    the point station data onto a 2D regular grid, thereby furnishing a comprehensive array of visualization and
    analytical tools for this multidimensional dataset. This includes scatter displays as well as associated
    statistical analyses.
  </p>
</faqitem>

<faqitem id="nongeotimeseries" q="Non Geo Point Data" >
  <p>
    The IDV has incorporated support for displaying non-geolocated time series datasets. Furthermore, the IDV offers
    a range of statistical analysis formulas, encompassing area averages, level averages, maximum, minimum, mean,
    percentiles, and summations. The results of these analyses can now be produced as non-geolocated data and
    exported in formats such as CSV or netCDF. This newly introduced feature empowers users to leverage the IDV's
    versatile access to multiple data servers, enabling them to preprocess data for applications including machine
    learning and other scientific uses.

<faqitem id="addeupdate" q="ADDE Update">
  <p>
    We have undertaken a comprehensive update of our ADDE services, with a primary focus on transforming ADDE into a
    service that can seamlessly transition to new systems while retaining its original service name, adde.ucar.edu.
    As part of this initiative, we have strategically diminished and redefined certain ADDE dataset definitions that
    we oversee across all of our public-facing ADDE servers. This strategic adjustment is aimed at enhancing both
    the usability and long-term continuity of these datasets.

<faqitem id="wmsupdate" q="IDV WMS Update">

  <p>
    In recent releases, there had been an issue concerning connectivity to the USGS WMS server, resulting in
    SSLHandshakeException error messages. We have successfully pinpointed the root cause as the trustedCerts
    configuration from the Unidata web server. To address this, we have taken measures to eliminate the conflict
    arising from the SSLHandshake specification within the bundle libraries, and subsequently generated a new
    ramadda jar file. With these adjustments in place, the updated libraries included in this release now enable
    seamless access to a multitude of WMS servers within the IDV.

<faqitem id="gdiformulas" q="Galvez-Davison Index">
  <p>
    The GÃ¡lvez-Davison Index (GDI) is a stability index developed to enhance the accuracy of thunderstorm predictions
    and predict shallower forms of moist convection in tropical regions. The newly introduced formula calculates GDI
    using temperature and relative humidity 3D grid fields.
  </p>
</faqitem>

<faqitem id="dryformulas" q="Dry Static Energy">
  <p>
    The new grid diagnostics formula calculates Dry Static Energy with Temperature and Geopotential
    Height 3D grid fields.
  </p>
</faqitem>

<faqitem id="2d3dgrid" q="3D and 2D grid subtract and multiply">
  <p>
    The new grid diagnostics formula performs a vertical subtraction/multiplication of a 2D grid from a 3D grid.
