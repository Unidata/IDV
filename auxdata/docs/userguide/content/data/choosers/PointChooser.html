The  [ug::chooser Point] chooser allows you to choose
global hourly surface weather  station observations (METAR), and  Synoptic data
from remote ADDE servers.
[ht::cimg images/PointChooser.gif {Point Data Chooser}]


To select Point data:
<ol>
[ug::step {Specify an ADDE server and  data type and press connect.
This chooser works similarly to the  Image chooser described above.
Once connected to a server the list of available
times will be shown.}]

[ug::step {Choose a relative set of times steps (e.g., Last 5 times).
When choosing relative times you can set the time increment to use, e.g., 
Using &quot;3 most recent&quot; times with a &quot;3&quot;hour time
increment would result in the most recent time, one 3 from 3 hours
ago and one from 6 hours ago.}]

[ug::step {You may choose a relative set of times steps (e.g., Last 5 times):} images/ImageStep4.gif]

[ug::step {Or, choose a set of absolute times (e.g., 12Z, 1Z):} images/ImageStep5.gif {
When choosing
absolute times for the first time the IDV needs to query the ADDE server
for the times. This may take some time.
Times can be selected in the list or the time line
(use control/click or shift/click in the list to select multiple times).
See the <a href="../../tools/Timeline.html">Timeline section</a> for details on its use.
}]

[ug::step {Or, match the times of the current active display window:} images/MatchTimeDriver.gif {
This assumes the current active display window has a display with the time driver set. A
display can be set as a time driver in the <a href="../FieldSelector.html#TimeMatchingFS">Time Subset panel</a>
in the Field Selector tab or the <a href="../../controls/index.html#DisplayControlViewMenu">
View</a> menu in the Dashbaord's Displays tab.
}]

[ug::step {When done, load the selected point data with the [ug::button Add Source] button.}]

</ol>
