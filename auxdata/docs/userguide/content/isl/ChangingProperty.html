[isl::tagdef displayproperties  {Changing bundle display properties} -attrs {display+ {the display with properties that need to be changed}
property+ {name and new value of the existing property } }]
The [isl::tag displayproperties] tag allows you to change the existing properties in a bundle file. For example,
this could be used to change the probe location, chart name, etc.

<p>
In this example, we use the displayproperties tag to change two existing properties in the bundle RUC.xidv. First, the IDV
needs to identify the display to search for existing properties, which is the ProbeControl. After we identify the display,
the IDV uses the property name and new value to replace the existing property, and the two properties being changed are probe location
 and chart name.

In the next example, we use the displayproperties tag to change two existing properties: the smoothing type and the smoothing factor,
in the bundle RUC.xidv. First, the IDV needs to identify the display to search for existing properties, which is the ContourPlanViewControl.
After we identify the display, the IDV uses the property name and new value to replace the existing property, and the new smoothing type
and factor being applied to contours.

[isl::importxml contourSmoothing.isl]

In the third example, we use the displayproperties tag to change two end points of a cross section in the bundle RUC.xidv.
First, the IDV needs to identify the display to search for existing properties, which is the ContourCrossSectionControl.
After we identify the display, the IDV uses the property name and new value to replace the existing property, and the new
end points being applied to the cross section.
