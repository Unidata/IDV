[ht::desc More about Jython in the IDV: rainfall rate estimated from Level III radar imagery]

<h3>Radar Reflectivity and Rainfall Rates</h3>

<p>
created by Charlie Murphy, Kean University, Union, New Jersey

<P>

The Marshall-Palmer distribution is the basis for a relationship
  between radar reflectivity Z and the rainfall rate R. For more information 
  about the Marshall-Palmer distribution refer to
  [ht::popup "https://www.roc.noaa.gov/ops/z2r_osf5.asp" "https://www.roc.noaa.gov/ops/z2r_osf5.asp"]. The empirical relationship 
  estimating reflectivity from rainfall rate is 
  dBZ=aR**b,
where a and b are constants depending upon precipitation regime 
(units of Z in mm**6/m**3 and R in mm/hr) .
We will now create and apply a Jython function to covert a 
WSR-88D Level III radar
  reflectivity image into a gridded estimate of rainfall rates,
and make contour plots of the results.

<p>

Inverting the Marshall-Palmer relationship, 
we obtain for a rainfall rate estimate

<ul><pre>R= ( (10**(dBZ/10))/a )**(1/b)</pre></ul>

<ol class="step">

<li>Setup</li>
  <ul class="substep">
    <li>[ht::clearDisplaysAndData]
    <li>Make sure the menu item
    <code class="menu">Maps-&gt;Reset projection with new data</code> 
    is checked on.
    </ul>
</li>

<li>Load the data</li>
  <ul class="substep">
  <li>Load the bundle file: </li>

<pre>
  <%workshop.sitepath%>/radar-setup.xidv 
</pre>

   Use the [ht::command URL:] entry box in the 
   [ht::dialog Data Source Chooser].  [ht::cutAndPasteTip]
   This bundle points to some of the Bow Echo Case study 
   level III radar data for DVN  for 6/29/98. 
   The bundle automatically finds the data, 
   downloads 4 time steps, and makes a display of
   reflectivity. This should take less than 30 seconds.
  <li>Zoom in and 
  look at the image to get an idea of the radar reflectivity for 
  this case.</li>
  </ul>


<li>View the Jython Method</li>
  <ul class="substep">

  <li>Now we will use a Jython method to convert dBZ into rainfall 
  rate estimates. Click the main menu item
  <code class="menu">Edit-&gt;Formulas-&gt;Jython library</code>  
  from the main menu bar to get the editor window. 
<li>Click on the tab [ht::command .../default.py].  (This assumes you
are running the IDV with the workshop site path. If not, enter the
method below by hand.)
<li>You should see this method:

    <ul><pre>
#
# function dBz2R to calculate rainfall rate from dBz reflectivity
#
def dBz2R(dBz, a=200, b=1.6):
      a = float(a)
      b = float(b)
      # a Z to R relation, where a and b are 
      # Marshall-Palmer constants. Results in in/hr.
      c=10.**(dBz/10.)
      d=c/a
      r=d**(1.0/b)
      r=0.039*r
      return r
</pre></ul>
  The terms <b>a=200, b=1.6</b> supply default values for the 
  two constants a and b in the formula, which depend on rainfall regime.
  </ul>
</li>

<li>Create a Formula using the Method dBz2R</li>
  <ul class="substep">

  <li>To implement this method you need to create a new formula 
  to call it (for more see 
[ht::popup "SimpleFormulas.html" "IDV Formulas"]).
  Use the menu choice [ht::command Edit->Formulas->Create Formula].
  <li>The formula expression is simply  
  <ul><pre><b>dBz2R(dbz)</b></pre></ul>
  Give the new formula a 
  Name (such as "ZtoR"), a Description (such as "Z to R calculation")
  and the Group "workshop".
  For <code class="command">Displays to Use</code>, click off the
  <code class="command">Use all displays</code> and click on 
  [ht::display Contour Plan View] and 
  [ht::display Color Shaded Plan View].  Enter the formula in the
  <code class="command">Formula</code> box.
  (Note this does not have the <b>a=200, b=1.6</b> arguments; Jython will
  use the values inside the method definition).
  </ul>
</li>

<li>Now you can invoke the formula to convert the radar 
  reflectivity image to rainfall rates in mm/hr. 
  <ul class="substep">
  <li>Click on the formula name, select [ht::display Contour Plan View] for
  your display type, and click on [ht::command Create Display].

  <li>In the [ht::dialog Field Selector] click on Image Sequence
  and click on [ht::command OK].
  <li>This calculation may take a minute or more for all times.
  </ul>
</li>

<li>Examine the display of rainfall rates  in mm/hr.
Start time animation and you will see the contours over the radar image. 

<li>Now create a rainfall rate color shaded image
   to help you see the rainfall rates
  corresponding to the colors from the color table. Select your formula and 
  [ht::display Color Shaded Plan View] 
  for the display type, pick the same radar data object
  as you did for the Contour Plan View. 
  Note that there is no time delay for this display - the results
  of the computation are cached and used again.
  <li>To help visualize the rainfall rate 
  apply a different color table to your rainfall 
  rate image by choosing in the control window 
  <code class="menu">Color Table -&gt;Radar-&gt;ATD-&gt;Reflectivity</code>
  <li>Compare the contours to the rainfall rate image, and zoom in
  to get a closer view of the values of the 
  rainfall rates from the contour labels.
  You can click on the legend for either the contours or the color shaded
  image to turn them on and off for better viewing.
  </ul>
</li>

<li>Parameterizing the Arguments to the Method</li>
  <ul class="substep">
  <li>There are two "constants" in the Z-R calculation which 
  are not constant but which 
  depend on the precipitation regime, a and b.  You can have them
  specified by the user at run time rather than using fixed values.
  <li>In the formula definition change the formula to
<pre>
    dBz2R(dBz, user_a, user_b)
</pre>
  The [ht::qt user_] part of these operands 
  is special and denotes to the IDV numeric
  or string operands that are to be provided by the user through a prompt.
  <li>When you run the formula you will be asked for values for a and b,
  as well as for dBz. Use a somewhat less than 200 and b somewhat
  less than 1.6 to see larger values in the result.</li>
</ul>
</li>
