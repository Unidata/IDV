Clicking on the main menu bar choice 
[ug::menu Help {Show console}] 
shows a console window which has
error messages and other text output from the IDV. Error messages
created before you open the console are shown, as well as later ones.

<p>

The console is useful
if you encounter an error. Please save the console message to a file
and include it in email to IDV Support at Unidata.
