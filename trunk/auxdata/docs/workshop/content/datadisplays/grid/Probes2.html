<title>Probing Gridded Data (continued) </title>
</head>

<body>



Now, let's look at other probes that can be used with 3D data -
the Time/Height Display and the Grid Skew-T probe.  The Time/Height
display will show the variation of a field with height over
time.  The Grid Skew-T probe will display a model sounding generated from
the data.<p>

<ol>
<li>First, let's create a time/height display of relative humidity.
We'll also load in an isosurface of this field for comparison.  You
can load in a probe without displaying the field in the main display.<p>

  <ul class="substep">
    <li>If you have not already done so, use the 
        [ht::menu Edit {Remove All Displays}] menu to remove the displays
        created in the previous exercise.</li>
    <li>First, we'll load in a time/height display of relative humidity.
        In the  [ht::command Fields] panel, expand the 
         [ht::param 3D grid] tab. 
        Select the  [ht::param relative humidity] field.</li>
    <li>In the  [ht::command Displays] panel, select 
         [ht::display Isosurface] (under the
         [ht::display 3D Surface] tab).  Then, hold the 
        [ht::command Ctrl] key down and click on
         [ht::display Time/Height Display (Contours)] 
         (under the [ht::display Probes] tab) to select both. 
         Click the [ht::button Create Display] button.
        Once the displays are created, set the isosurface value
        to <b>80%</b> and minimize the isosurface control window.</li>
    <li>Move the probe around to see how relative humidity varies
        with time and height at a particular location.  Now, move the
        probe over Iowa.</li>
    <li>Tilt the main display so you can see the structure of the
        relative humidity isosurface at the probe location, then
        step through the animation and compare the structure you
        see in the isosurface to the structure at the same time
        in the time/height display.  How do they compare?</li>
    <li>Stop the animation and return to the first time step.</li>
  </ul>
</li>
<p>

<li> Now, we'll create a Skew-T display of calculated model parameters.<p>
  <ul class="substep">
    <li>In the  [ht::command Fields] panel, expand the 
         [ht::param 3D grid] tab. 
        Expand the  [ht::param Derived] tab and select the 
        [ht::param {Sounding Data (with true winds)}] field.  
        This derived quantity will show up when the grid contains
        temperature, dewpoint and wind fields or any of these
        that can be derived from others.</li>
    <li>In the [ht::command Displays] panel, select the
        [ht::display Grid Skew-T] display.  Click
        the [ht::button Create Display] button.</li>
    <li>Undock the [ht::display Time/Height] and the
        [ht::display Grid Skew-T] displays from the Dashboard.
        Arrange your windows so you can see the main display, the
        SkewT display and the Time/Height display.
    <li>Now, share the probe position with the Time/Height Display.
        In each of the control windows, use the
        [ht::menu Edit Sharing {Sharing On}] menu to turn on
        sharing of the probe position. Move the probe over Iowa slightly
        to align the two probes.  </li>
    <li>Step through the animation and compare model temperature and
        dewpoint profiles with Time/Height display.  In regions of
        high relative humidity, the temperature and dewpoint profiler
        will be close together.</li>
  </ul>
</li>

</ol>
