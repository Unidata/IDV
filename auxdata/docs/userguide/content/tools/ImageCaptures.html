You can capture the main 3D view as an image,
a QuickTime movie or an animated GIF.


<%childlist%>

[ht::subhead jpegcapture {Saving Images} {intoc="false"}]

You can save a display as an image. Select the 
[ug::menu View  Capture {Image...}] menu item.  
A file dialog will
popup where you can enter a file name for the image file. The IDV
supports JPEG, PNG and GIF formats.
From this File Dialog you can also specify the image quality (only 
used for JPEG's) and what to capture.

<p>
Note: when capturing a image the screen cannot be obscured.
<p>
The IDV can also write out an image and the corresponding
Google Earth KML or KMZ file. For this to be correct the
projection must be a Lat/Lon geographic projection (i.e.,  rectilinear)
and in an overhead view.  The simplest way to get a correct projection
is to select the [ug::menu Projections {Use Displayed Area}]
menu item. If you specify a .kml file the IDV will generate
an image with the same file prefix and the kml file that refers
to the image. If you specify a .kmz file the IDV this file
(which is a zip format) will contain the image and the kml file.


[ht::subhead printcapture {Print Current View} {intoc="false"}]

You can send any display to a printer. Select the
[ug::menu View  Capture {Print...}] menu item.
A <b>Print</b> dialog will popup where you can configure and print an image.

[ht::subhead moviecapture {Save Movies} {intoc="false"}]

You can save any sequence of displays as a QuickTime movie or animated GIF. 
Select the [ug::menu View  Capture {Movie...}] menu item
to bring up  the &quot;Image capture&quot;  window:

[ht::cimg images/VMImageCapturePopup.gif]

To make a QuickTime movie or animated GIF
there are three steps: capturing the frames, previewing the
frames, and creating the movie.

<p>


To capture frames, in the <b>Capture</b> section of the "Image capture"
window, do one of the following three choices:

<ul>

<li>click on the <b>One Image</b> button to make a single frame
of the current IDV display. Then you change the display to exactly what
you want in the next frame, capture that new image, and continue through
the movie.

<li> Click on <b>Time Animation</b> to automatically capture all
frames in a display time sequence which you can animate with the usual
IDV <a href="../ui/Animation.html">Time Animation Controls</a>. Check
<b>Reset to start time</b> to ensure that you capture the entire
animation sequence. The movie animation capture starts on the first
frame visible in the IDV and goes to the end. So you can use this to
capture part of a sequence.


<li> Click on <b>Automatically</b> to start taking snapshots of
frames from the IDV display while you make changes, such as 
changing the viewpoint by zooming, rotation, and panning, and combinations
of all three. To stop the automatic snapshots, click on the button again
(which now says Stop). You can set the automatic snapshot sampling rate
with the [ug::button Rate] field. 

</ul>

You can combine these different methods of capture. The list of frames
is additive.


<p> If you want to save the individual intermediate files that are used
to create the movie, select [ug::button Save Files To] checkbox and
specify a directory and file name format. Otherwise, the intermediate
files will be saved in a temporary directory and will be removed after
the movie is saved.</p>

<p> You can use the following templates to customize the name of the
output file:

<ul>
<li><b>%count%</b> is the image counter
<li><b>%count:decimal format%</b> allows you to format the count using
the same rules defined in the  lat/lon format section of the
<a href="../tools/Preferences.html">User Preferences</a>. (or
Google 'java decimalformat' for more information).
<li><b>%time%</b> is the  animation time in the default format
<li><b>%time:time format%</b> a template that begins with 
"time:" and contains a time format string using the 
the same date formatting rules described in the
<a href="../tools/Preferences.html">User Preferences</a>.
</ul>

<p> You can [ug::button Preview] the movie and remove individual frames 
or [ug::button Delete All] the frames. </p>


<p>When done capturing frames select the [ug::button Save movie] button
to specify the QuickTime movie file (.mov) or the animated GIF file (.gif). 

<p>You can now set the final properties of the movie you wish to save:

[ht::cimg images/VMImageCapturePopup2.gif]

<ul>
<li><b>Save As:</b> Name of the movie file you wish to create.
<li><b>Frames per second:</b> Number of captured images to show (per 
second).
<li><b>End Frame Pause:</b> Time (in seconds) to pause the last image in 
the movie.
<li><b>Save viewpoints</b>: Save the viewpoints (check to enable). 
<li><b>File Format:</b> Format of the movie file.
</ul>


[ht::subhead  movieplayback {Play QuickTime Movies} {intoc="false"}]

The IDV supports displaying certain types of QuickTime movies (including
the ones the IDV generates). Just load in the QuickTime movie from
the File Data Chooser.
