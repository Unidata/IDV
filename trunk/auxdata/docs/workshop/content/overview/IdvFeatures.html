<div class="overview">
The IDV has many features that make it an ideal tool for analysis
and display of geoscience data.
</div>

<ul class="step">

<li><b>Integrated displays of a variety of data types</b> 
       <details title="Integrated displays of a variety of data types">
       The IDV supports combining displays of a wide range of geoscience
       data including satellite imagery, gridded data, surface
       observations), upper air soundings, flight tracks, NWS NEXRAD
       Level II and Level III RADAR data, NOAA National Profiler Network
       data and some forms of GIS data.</details></li>

<li><b>Support for a variety of data access methods</b> 
       <details title="Support for a variety of data access methods">
       Directly reads netCDF, Vis5D, McIDAS AREA and map (OUTL*) files, 
       NEXRAD Level II and III radar data, ESRI Shapefiles, and 
       Arc/Info ASCIIGRID files.  Provides access 
       to other data formats (e.g., GINI, NEXRAD Level III, HDF) 
       through the Abstract Data Distribution Environment (ADDE) 
       and OPeNDAP/DODS protocols.</details></li>

<li><b>Multiple 2- and 3-D display types</b> 
       <details title="Multiple 2- and 3-D display types">
       Users can display the same data in a variety of 2- and 3-D
       visualizations such contours, color-shaded cross sections,
       isosurfaces and profiles.</details></li>

<li><b>Interactive probes</b> 
       <details title="Interactive probes">
       The IDV supports a variety of data probes that are used for
       creating location dependent value readouts and vertical profiles
       for multi-dimensional datasets.</details></li>

<li><b>User defined formulas</b> 
       <details title="User defined formulas">
       Supports user creation of derived products from a library of
       mathematical and meteorological operations.</details></li>

<li><b>Easy configuration</b> 
       <details title="Easy configuration">
       Much of the IDV, including the user interface, is configured
       through a set of eXtensible Markup Language (XML) files.
       Developers and users can easily tailor the IDV to provide custom
       applications based on the underlying framework by using their own
       set of configuration files. Everything from map projections to
       color tables to the available display components is configurable.
       A hierarchical set of XML files is used to control core, site
       and user preferences.</details></li>

<li><b>Bundling of user preferences</b> 
       <details title="Bundling of user preferences">
       The state (loaded data sources and data depictions) of the IDV
       can be saved to an XML &quot;bundles&quot; at any time. These
       bundles can be used to pre-configure the application, or can be
       loaded interactively while the IDV is in use. Users can share
       saved data views, complete with annotations.</details></li>

<li><b>Integrated documentation</b> 
       <details title="Integrated documentation">
       On-line User's Guide, Help Tips and a &quot;Getting Started&quot; guide 
       are available from within the application. </details></li>

<li><b>Extensive use of network resources:</b>

  <ul class="substep">
    <li><b>Client/Server data access</b>
       <details title="Client/Server data access">
        Access to data from ADDE and OPeNDAP/DODS servers allows
        subsetting of large datasets. THREDDS catalogs of data holdings
        indexed in digital libraries (e.g. DLESE) can be used for
        discovery and usage metadata.</details></li>

<!--
    <li><b>Integrated HTML Viewer</b>
        <details title="Integrated HTML Viewer">
        Web pages can be viewed in the special HTML viewer component.
        This viewer can interpret special embedded links to IDV
        displays, controls and IDV bundles within a standard HTML
        document, allowing educators to create class exercise in HTML,
        including powerful interactive, three-dimensional displays of
        remote data.</details></li>
-->

    <li><b>Use of Java Web Start</b>
        <details title="Use of Java Web Start">
        The IDV takes advantage of <a
        href="http://java.sun.com/products/javawebstart/"> Java's
        Web Start</a> technology to provide a seamless method for
        internet-based software distribution. The application can
        be launched from a web link pointing to a Java Network
        Launching Protocol (JNLP) file, which can include pointers to
        configuration files and bundles for customization. When a user
        clicks on the link, any JAR files or other ancillary data that
        has changed since the last time the application was launched are
        automatically downloaded and installed on the users system.</details></li>

<!--
    <li><b>Collaboration features</b> 
        <details title="Collaboration features">
        Users can share IDV sessions locally in a classroom or remotely
        through the Internet. This facility is configurable as
        peer-to-peer or in a client-server mode. An incorporated chat
        facility and drawing tool aid in communication.</details></li>
