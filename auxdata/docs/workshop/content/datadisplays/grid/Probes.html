<title>Probing Gridded Data </title>

<div class="overview">
<p> The IDV has a variety of data probes that can be used with
gridded data.  Probes include value readouts, vertical profiles,
model soundings, time/height cross sections and time series
displays.</p>
</div>


<p>
Let's create a data probe to read out various parameters 
at different levels.<p>

  <ul class="step">
    <li>If you have not already done so, use the 
        [ht::menu Edit {Remove All Displays}] menu to remove the displays
        created in the previous exercise.</li>
    <li>In the [ht::command Fields] panel, expand 
        the [ht::param 2D grid] tab. 
        Select the [ht::param {mean sea level pressure (ETA model reduction)}] 
        field.</li>
    <li>In the [ht::command Displays] panel, select 
        [ht::display Color-Shaded Plan View].  Expand the
        [ht::display Probes] tab, then, hold the 
        [ht::command Ctrl] key down and click on
        [ht::display Data Probe/Time Series] to select both. Click
        the [ht::button Create Display] button.
        Once the displays are created, you can minimize the
        control window for the color shaded display.</li>
    <li>Drag the selector point around in the main window and notice how
        the readout changes.</li>
    <li>Now, let's look at the difference between <i>Nearest Neighbor</i> and
        <i>Weighted Average</i> sampling techniques.
      <ul class="subsubstep">
        <li>Use the rubber band zooming feature (Shift+Mouse drag) on the
            main view window to zoom in over the central United
            States (centered on Kansas).  The blocky pattern you
            see shows the outline of each grid cell.</li>
        <li>Bring up the Control Window for the color shaded display
            and click the [ht::command Shade Colors]
            check box.  Notice how the pattern changes.  Return to the
            blocky pattern by unchecking the 
            [ht::command Shade Colors] checkbox.</li>
        <li>From the Probe Control window, right click on the 
            [ht::param Psl_et] line and select 
            the [ht::menu {Parameter: Psl_et} Copy] menu.</li>
            You will now have two entries for this field in
            the Probe control.</li>
        <li>Change one of the entries to sample using 
            <i>Weighted Average</i> by clicking in the table row under
            the [ht::command Sampling] column and 
            selecting that option from the dropdown list.</li>
        <li>Now move the probe around.  Notice how the values in the
            two rows differ as you move from grid cell to grid cell
            in the display.  <i>Nearest Neighbor</i> sampling will
            list out the value at the grid point.  <i>Weighted Average</i>
            sampling will list out a weighted average of the values
            at surrounding grid points.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Now, let's add in a 3D field to the list and sample that at
        different levels.
      <ul class="subsubstep">
        <li>First, return the main display to its unzoomed position.</li>
        <li>Right click on any row in the table and select the 
            [ht::menu Add parameter...] menu.</li>
        <li>From the [ht::command Field Selector],
            expand the  [ht::param 3D Grid] tab and select the
             [ht::param temperature]
            field. Click the [ht::button OK]
            button.  You will now see an entry for <b>T</b> in the
            table in the Probe control window that lists the
            [ht::command Level] as <i>Probe's</i>.  It will also be
            added to the chart.</li>
        <li>Move the probe to the north and you will see that in general
            temperature decreases at the probe's altitude.  Move it to 
            the south and you will see that in general temperature 
            increases.</li>
        <li>Now rotate the display to a south view.  Drag the probe up
            and down and notice how temperature changes with altitude
            in the atmosphere.</li>
        <li>Now, let's move the temperature to it's own chart.  Right click
            on the temperature line in the table and select
            the [ht::menu {Parameter T} {Line Properties}] menu 
            select the same menu from the contrl's [ht::menu View Parameters]
            menu.  
        <li>In the [ht::button Chart Name] box, type in <b>Temperature</b>.
            In the [ht::button Min] box, type in <b>-60</b> and for
            [ht::button Max], type in <b>30</b> and click OK.
        <li>Now add two more rows of Temperature to the table by copying
            the current temperature field.</li>
        <li>Change the  [ht::command Level] of one of 
            the temperature fields
            to be <i>850</i> hPa by clicking in the box for that row under
            the  [ht::command Level] column and selecting 
            that level from the list.  Change the  [ht::command Level] 
            of another of the temperature fields to be <i>500</i> hPa.</li>
        <li>Now move the probe around and you will get a readout of
            each of the fields at the specified levels.</li>
        <li>Start the animation to see how the field values change
            with time.</li>
        <li>Stop the animation and remove all displays.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
        
  </ul>
