Starting with vector or wind barb plan displays, you can switch 
to a streamline display using the wind display 
<a href="../controls/FlowPlanViewControl.html">Control</a>.
Make sure the skip interval is zero to see the best streamlines.
The Control also allows you to change size and color of the vectors and
barbs, skip data points to declutter the display, 
change the level of plan views,
toggle visibility, and remove the display.
