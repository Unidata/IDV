This section describes how to make a cross boundary subset of a cyclic rectilinear grid
as a <b>grid coverage type</b> dataset. The set of steps involve:

In the <a href="../data/choosers/index.html">Data Chooser</a> select the
<b>Catalogs</b> tab.

Choose one of the remote <b>Catalogs:</b>
such as  <b>https://thredds.ucar.edu/thredds/catalog.xml</b>
for Unidata's catalog of near real-time model output.

<p>

    A tree view of the catalog will be displayed. Open one, such
    as the &quot;GFS One Degree - Global Coverage model data (real and near time)&quot;,
    by clicking on one of the tab icons
    (<img alt="icon" src=../data/images/TreeTagClosed.gif>).

<p>

    Specify the data source type to be <b>Grid Coverage(netCDF/GRIB/OPENDAP/GEMPAK)</b>
    using the [ug::menu {Data Source Type}] drop down menu. The IDV defualts the type
    of model data as <b>Grid files(netCDF/GRIB/OPENDAP/GEMPAK)</b>.
    Only the "Grid Coverage" type has the feature of cross boundary spatial subset.

<p>
    The list of this model's run times appears. Click on "Best Time Series" or "Latest Collection" to select
    it, and then click on the <b>Add Source</b> button. You have selected
    the model output to be accessible by the IDV.

    <subhead id="spatialsubset" intoc="false">Cross Boundary Spatial Subsetting</subhead>

    You can spatially subset the grid on the [ug::tab Spatial Subset] tab of
    the Data Source Properties or the Field Selector.  This works similarly to
    the grid file subset where you can set properties for all fields of the Data Source or
    override the default property for a particular field on the field selector subset panel.
    The difference in the Coverage data spatial subset is that the [ug::button Flip map longitude] button
    at the bottom of the panel will allow user to flip longitudes in a cyclic rectilinear grid from
    0/360 to -180/180 (or vice-versa) before performing the cross boundary spatial subset.

    <a href="../data/DataSourceProperties.html">Data Source Properties</a>
    page of this User's Guide.


    <subhead id="selecting" intoc="false">To make a cross boundary 3D plot of GFS one degree
        data</subhead>


    The grid coverage data source that you selected will be shown in the
    <a href="../data/FieldSelector.html">Field Selector window</a>.
    In the <b>Fields</b> panel are folders of data parameters categorized as 2D and 3D fields.
    Click on the 3D grid tab (<img alt="icon" src=../data/images/TreeTagClosed.gif>)
    to expand that category, further expand Momentum and
    Derived tab, click on "Speed (from u-component_of_wind_isobaric &
    u-component_of_wind_isobaric)" and select "Isosurface" display type,
    click on the <b>Create Display</b> button to create a wind speed isosurface display. Create another
    Contour Plan View in the Plan Views Displays list. Both displays will be created and shown in the main window.
