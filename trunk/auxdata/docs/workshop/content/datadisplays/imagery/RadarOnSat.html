<title>Overlaying Radar on Satellite and other imagery</title>

<div class="overview">
You can create displays with both radar and satellite imagery
in the same view as well as separate views.
</div>

<p>First, load up a couple of satellite images.

<ol class="step">

  <li>If you haven't already done so, remove all displays.

  <li>From the [ht::dialog Field Selector] window,
      select the [ht::dataset 1 km GOES-8 Visible]
      data source.  </li>
      
  <li>Select the [ht::param 0.65 um Visible - Cloud Cover] 
      field in the [ht::command Fields] panel,
      and select [ht::display Image Sequence Display] 
      in the [ht::command Displays] panel.</li>

  <li>In the [ht::command Times] panel, uncheck
      the [ht::command Use Default] checkbox and 
      select the 1998-06-29 21:15:00Z and
      1998-06-29 22:15:00Z entries in the list. [ht::listSelect]

  <li>Click the [ht::button Create Display] button
      to load in those two images.</li>

</ol>

Now, let's overlay some radar imagery.  

<ol>

  <li>First, let's keep the satellite projection for now.  Uncheck
      the [ht::menu Projections {Auto-set Projection}] menu item.

  <li>From the [ht::dialog Field Selector] window,
      select the [ht::dataset {DVN (Base Reflectivity Tilt 1)}]
      data source.  </li>
      
  <li>Select the [ht::param Image Sequence] field 
      in the [ht::command Fields] panel,
      and select [ht::display Image Sequence display] 
      in the [ht::command Displays] panel.</li>

  <li>In the [ht::command Times] panel, make
      sure the [ht::command Use Default] checkbox
      is checked.</li>

  <li>Click the [ht::button Create Display] button
      to load in the images.</li>

  <li>Toggle between the two images by pressing the 
      [ht::command F1] key.
      [ht::popup /installandstart/basics/MouseAndKeyboard.html#viztoggle {} -useimg 1]
      </li>

  <li>Turn both images on by pressing the [ht::command F2]
      key.</li>


   [ht::cimg images/RadarOnSat.gif]

  <li>You can reproject data into any projection you want.
      Let's change to the local radar projection.
      
    <ul class="substep">
      
      <li>Select the base reflectivity display control's 
          [ht::menu View {Use Native Image Projection}] menu item to
          switch to the radar projection.</li>
          
      <li>Zoom in and out</li>

    </ul>
  </li>

  <li>You can also change the time animation steps to be more regular.
    <ul class="substep">
       <li>Open the [ht::dialog Time Animation Properties] dialog.
           <popup label="">
           Click the information icon in the [ht::command {Time Animation Widget}]
           toolbar.
           </popup>
       <li>Select the [ht::tab Define Animation Times] tab and then
       select the [ht::button Define your own list of times] option.
           [ht::cimg images/DefineTimes.gif]
       </li>
       <li>By default, the time animation is automatically determined from 
       the times of each dataset used in the display.  You can change
       the default using this widget.
       <li>For the [ht::command End Time] select the 
       [ht::command Relative to Start Time] option.  </li>
       <li>Click the edit icon ([ht::img %dotpath%images/edit.gif])
       to the right of the [ht::command Offset:] label to
       set the offset from the start time. Set the offset to be
       1 hour from the start time by typing <b>1</b> in the 
       [ht::command hours] box, then click [ht::button OK].</li>
       <li>Set the [ht::command Interval] to be <b>10</b> minutes and
       set the [ht::command {Round to}] option to <b>5</b> minutes.</li>
       <li>Click [ht::button Apply] and notice how this changes the time
       steps in the display.</li>
       <li>Try other combinations and see what effect they have.</li>
       
    </ul>
   

  <li>Remove all displays.
</ol>

You can also overlay radar and satellite images on top of a
background image from a Web Map Server (WMS).
        
<ol>

  <li> [ht::backgroundImage]


  <li>Change the layer type for this
      control to [ht::command Shaded Relief].</li>

  <li>From the [ht::dialog Field Selector] window,
      select the [ht::dataset {DVN (Base Reflectivity Tilt 1)}]
      data source.  </li>
      
  <li>Select the [ht::param Image Sequence] field 
      in the [ht::command Fields] panel,
      and select [ht::display Image display] 
      in the [ht::command Displays] panel.
      In the [ht::command Times] panel, make
      sure the [ht::command Use Default] checkbox
      is checked and then click the 
      [ht::button Create Display] button
      to load in the images.</li>

  <li>Toggle the images as you did above and use different layers in
      the control.  We will look at this control in more detail later.

  <li>Remove all displays.
</ol>
