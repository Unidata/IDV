<faqitem  id="j8282" q="OpenJDK Java Version">

  <p>
    Due to the end of Oracle Java free release updates, the IDV project has
    officially moved from Oracle JDK to OpenJDK packages that receives support via the
    community. The AdoptOpenJDK provides prebuilt binaries from OpenJDK class libraries. All AdoptOpenJDK
    binaries and scripts are open source licensed and available for free. The version of the
    AdoptOpenJDK distributed with the IDV is 1.8.0_282. See
    the <a href=https://adoptopenjdk.net/> adoptOpenJDK Library</a> for a more details information.

<faqitem id="radargriddisplay1" q="More with Level II Radar Grid Displays">
  <p>
    With the newly developed Level 2 radar grid display feature, we've expanded its capabilities by
    incorporating derived formulas to calculate radar precipitation rates. These calculations are based
    on two key approaches: the Marshall-Palmer drop size distribution and dual polarization radar data.
    The Marshall-Palmer method provides a traditional estimate of precipitation rates using reflectivity,
    while the dual polarization approach enhances accuracy by factoring in both reflectivity and
    differential reflectivity. These advancements allow for more precise and varied precipitation rate
    calculations, improving radar data interpretation and weather analysis.

<faqitem id="multiVarsCrossSection" q="Multi Variables Cross-Section Display" >
  <p>
    After creating the first vertical cross-sections display, you can add a contour cross-section display
    for a second variable as well as a wind vector cross-section display for a derived variable. When
    working multi variables cross-section displays, we recommend using a color-filled contour display or
    a color-shaded display, and contour displays for the second or the third variables. Multi-variable cross-section
    displays offer several advantages in data visualization and analysis, such as enhanced data comparisons,
    comprehensive analysis, and efficient use of screen space. Additionally, you can now switch the vertical
    coordinate scale from meters to pressure in hPa, providing greater flexibility in interpreting the data.

<faqitem id="timeheightdisplay" q="Two Variables Time Height Display" >
  <p>
    A time-height display shows samples of a 3D parameter along a vertical profile from top to bottom of
    the available data, with time as the independent coordinate (x-axis). You can choose between contour,
    color-filled, and color-shaded time-height displays. After creating the time-height display for the
    first variable, you can add a contour time-height display for a second variable. This setup allows
    for a more detailed and layered analysis of vertical atmospheric data over time. Additionally, you can
    now switch the vertical coordinate scale from meters to pressure in hPa, providing greater flexibility
    in interpreting the data.

<faqitem id="zoomenhancement" q="Zoom Enhancement">
  <p>
    We have updated the algorithm responsible for calculating the clip distance during zoom operations in
    both map and globe views. This enhancement ensures that users can now zoom in to street level without
    experiencing the disappearance of 3D objects, improving the overall user experience. The refined
    algorithm dynamically adjusts the clip distance based on zoom levels, allowing for seamless and
    detailed visualization at various scales. This update is particularly beneficial for users requiring
    precise close-up views in 3D environments, making the zoom functionality more reliable and effective.

<faqitem id="classifierformulas" q="Classifier">
  <p>
    Data classification helps in organizing data into categories based on sensitivity, importance, or other
    criteria. In machine learning, classification involves assigning a class label to a given input data example.
    The Jython Classifier formula provides a simple method to label 2D gridded data values with numbers.
    This basic classification algorithm is used to sort data points into different classes, allowing machine
    learning applications to train on existing data and predict the classification of new data points.

<faqitem id="medianfilterformulas" q="Median Filter">
  <p>
    A median filter is a non-linear digital filtering technique widely used in image processing to reduce noise.
    It works by replacing the center pixel in a neighborhood with the median value of that surrounding window.
    This technique is particularly effective at removing Gaussian, random, and salt-and-pepper noise from images.
    Due to its effectiveness, the median filter is commonly used in the data preprocessing stage of machine
    learning applications.

<faqitem id="2dfunctiongrid" q="2D function over grid">
  <p>
    Applying spatial functions like Max, Min, Average, and Percentile over a 2D grid allows you to generate
    a new time series point field. By applying these functions to the 2D grid, you transform spatial data into
    a time series that reflects specific statistical properties, offering new insights into the dataâ€™s temporal
    dynamics and preprocessing the data of machine learning applications.
