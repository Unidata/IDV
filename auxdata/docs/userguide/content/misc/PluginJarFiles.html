Note: This page is intended for someone who wants to create an IDV 
plugin. A description of installing and managing plugins is 
<a href="../tools/Plugins.html">here</a>.

<p>
The IDV supports a plugin architecture that allows for the easy extension 
and addition of functionality. A plugin is most commonly a Java Jar file
that contains a set of resource files (e.g., color tables) and/or
Java class files. The plugins are stored on a local directory or could be
loaded form a web site. The IDV processes the plugin Jar file at run time
loading in the contained resources and code.


<subhead intoc="false" id="basics">Basic Plugin</subhead>
Lets suppose you have created a set of color tables and some Jython
code that you want to  make a plugin with. As described in the
<a href="SiteConfiguration.html">Site Configuration</a> docs
the IDV stores these user created files in &lt;user home&gt;/.metappps/DefaultIdv
as colortables.xml and default.py.
<p>
To make these into a plugin, e.g., myplugin.jar, simply jar the the files (you need
to get a Java SDK for this):
<pre>
jar -cvf myplugin.jar colortables.xml default.py
</pre>

Now this plugin can be distributed to others and loaded into their IDV environment.
<p>
So, you might ask how does the IDV recognize  these files in the plugin
and treat them appropriately? The IDV loads in a set of resources (e.g.,
color tables, Python libraries). Each resource type is identified by a 
regular expression as shown in the 
<a href="SiteConfiguration.html#resources">resource list</a>.
In  our example above the file name <i>colortables.xml</i> matches
the pattern for color table xml resources.

<p>
Now, what happens if you have some file whose name does not match a pattern?
Say, you have a color table xml file called
<i>myspecialtables.xml</i> that you want to include in a bundle.
In that case you can add a <i>.rbi</i> file, as described
<a href="SiteConfiguration.html">here</a>,
that defines this file as a resource:
[ug::xml {
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1"?>
<resourcebundle>
  <resources name="idv.resource.colortables">
    <resource location="/myspecialtables.xml"/>
  </resources>
</resourcebundle>
}]


This acts as a table of contents for the plugin. Make sure that the location
is not relative. Note: Jar files can contain directory trees. e.g., /tables/myspecialtables.xml.
In this case just have the location point to:
[ug::xml {
...
    <resource location="/tables/myspecialtables.xml"/>
...
}]



<subhead intoc="false" id="advanced">Including Code</subhead>
You can also include code that implements certain functionality by just including
the Java .class files in the Jar. When you do this you need to include them
like a normal class containing Jar file, i.e., the package structure of
your code (e.g., edu.ucar.app.Test) needs to be reflected in the
directory structure of the Plugin Jar file:<pre>
/edu/ucar/app/Test.class
</pre>

For a single class file this is not necessarily required but if there are multiple
class files that have interdependency among themselves then you will get into
trouble if you don't follow this structure.
<p>
Now, what this code does can be anything and is best left up to the developer's guide.
