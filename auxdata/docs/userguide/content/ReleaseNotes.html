<faqitem cat="System Changes"></faqitem>

<faqitem q="Java Version 1.8" id="jv18">
  <p>
    Migrated the IDV to Java 8 and Java3D 1.6. The IDV is now using
    Java 1.8 JVM on all platforms of this release.
  </p>
</faqitem>

<faqitem q="Latest netCDF-Java Version" id="nj46">
  <p>
    The version of the netCDF-Java library currently distributed with the IDV is the 4.6.2. Its main
    feature is a rewrite of GRIB handling. This version of netCDF-Java includes changes:
      AWIPSsat projection, WRF lat/lon coordinates with time dependence, Updated grib1 table for NLDAS,
      handling of scalar runtime coordinate for GRIB collections.
      See the <a href="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/blogs/news/entry/netcdf_java_library_and_tds10">
    netCDF-Java Library</a> for a more details on these changes.

<faqitem cat="Display Changes"></faqitem>

<faqitem q="Forecast hour added" id="fhour">
The IDV can now calculate the forecast hours based on the run time coordinate system and values
  can be accessed through the forecast hour macro in the display properties window.
</faqitem>

<faqitem q="New Grid Trajectory and Curly Vector" id="ngtrajectory">
The new 2D grid trajectory and the curly vector display are based on the new APIs of the VisAD library.
  Both displays are categorized as flow vector display. The vector plan view display will be created
  first and there are radio buttons to switch to the trajectory or curly vector display. The trajectory
  and the curly vector can also be colored by the wind speed.
</faqitem>

<faqitem q="3D Adaptive Resolution" id="3dAR">
  The Adaptisve Resolution (AR) feature in the IDV has been expanded to cover several 3 dimensional displays.
  When creating a 3D display or cross section display, the IDV calculates the resolution of the map view window,
  dynamically sets the data sampling in all 3 dimensions, and loads sufficient data to generate the image.

<faqitem cat="Bug Fixes/Known Problems"></faqitem>

<faqitem q="Bug Fixes" id="bugfix">
We fixed a few bugs associated with the time matching in this release. One of the bug is the excessive loading
  of data in the bundle when there is a derived of derived parameters. The another bug fixed is in the 3D grid
  trajectory display in which the time subset information not correctly saved in the bundle.
