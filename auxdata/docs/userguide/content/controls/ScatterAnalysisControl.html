{Scatter Analysis Controls}

{

The Scatter Analysis controls are used to create a scatter plot within IDV. The scatter controls show three different panels:

[ht::cimg images/ScatterAnalysisControl.gif]



<p>
The plot on the first panel on the left represents the first field selected in the <strong>Field Selector</strong>,
the panel in the middle represents the second field which is selected through the Field Selector window, and
the panel on the right is the scatter analysis of the two fields. The first field selected is represented on the
X-axis (abscissa) and the second field selected represents the Y-axis (ordinate). The X-axis is selected in
the <strong>Field Selector</strong> - the channel selected in the lower right <strong>Channels</strong> tab
will be used as the X-axis.
<p>
Regions can be subsetted in any of the three panels, and the equivalent points will also be selected in the
other two panels. For example, if a box is drawn in panel 1, the same box will be drawn in panel 2, and the
points in these boxes will be colored the same in panel 3, the scatter analysis. To draw a box, select a Box
radio icon and a color and use Shift+left-click and drag to select a region. Any enclosed shape can be drawn
by selecting the Curve radio button and a color and using left-click and drag in any panel to select a region.
A user is allowed one box and one curve per color in the scatter analysis (panel 3), and one box and one curve
for the images (panels 1 and 2). To remove a region that has been subsetted, double-click on the color of the
region to remove next to the Box/Curve radio buttons.

<p>
Right-click on the color bar below the images to open the <a href="../tools/ColorTableEditor.html">Color Table Editor</a>,
change the range, select other color tables, etc.

<p>
Under the scatter analysis, there is a <strong>Background Color</strong> option that allows for setting the background
color of the scatter analysis.  This defaults to black.  When white is selected, the background will be come white and
the scatter plot axes and labels will change to black.

<p>
To the right of the Box/Curve options, there is a
<img src="images/ComputeStatistics.gif" width="140" height="26" alt="Compute Statistics button"align="absmiddle"> button.
Clicking this button will Scatter Statistics window that will list statistical information about the data as a whole,
as well as the regions of the data that were subsetted with a box/curve. The values in the white columns are computed
for the image as a whole, and the values in the colored columns are computed for the area of the respective box/curve.
