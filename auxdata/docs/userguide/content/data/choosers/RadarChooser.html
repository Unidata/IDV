The [ug::chooser Radar] chooser contains three sub-tabs that allow you to choose
NEXRAD Level III data on remote ADDE servers or NEXRAD Level II/III data from your file system or a remote THREDDS Data Server (TDS).


[ht::cimg images/Level3Chooser.gif {Level III Radar Chooser}]

The [ug::chooser Level III] chooser  works similarly to the Image chooser described above:
<ol>

[ug::step "Choose an ADDE [ug::menu Server] and a [ug::menu Dataset] to use:" images/RadarStep1.gif]

[ug::step "Press [ug::button Connect]:" images/RadarStep2.gif {This causes  the IDV to query 
the server for available radar types and stations.}]

[ug::step {Select a station using the map:} {images/RadarStep3.gif} ]

[ug::step {Select a radar type:} images/RadarStep4.gif {Once a station and a radar type has been selected the ADDE server will be queried
as to the available times.
Optionally, you can override the default data type that is returned.
}]

[ug::step {You may choose a relative set of times steps (e.g., Last 5 times):} images/ImageStep4.gif]

[ug::step {Or, choose a set of absolute times (e.g., 12Z, 1Z):} images/ImageStep5.gif {
When choosing
absolute times for the first time the IDV needs to query the ADDE server
for the times. This may take some time.
Times can be selected in the list or the time line
(use control/click or shift/click in the list to select multiple times).
See the <a href="../../tools/Timeline.html">Timeline section</a> for details on its use.
}]

[ug::step {Or, match the times of the current active display window:} images/MatchTimeDriver.gif {
This assumes the current active display window has a display with the time driver set. A
display can be set as a time driver in the <a href="../FieldSelector.html#TimeMatchingFS">Time Subset panel</a>
in the Field Selector tab or the <a href="../../controls/index.html#DisplayControlViewMenu">
View</a> menu in the Dashbaord's Displays tab.
}]


[ug::step "When done, load the selected radar data with the [ug::button Add Source] button."]

</ol>
