The IDV can be scripted to create and manipulate images and movies.
The scripting is accomplished using Jython or through an XML file: 
<i>IDV Scripting Language</i> (ISL). The ISL file can be opened from a running
IDV or one can be passed to the IDV as a command line argument:
<pre>
runIDV capture.isl
</pre>

A Jython script can be invoked as a command line argument:
<pre>
runIDV -islfile capture.py
</pre>

You can also run the IDV in interactive mode  using an ISL script to
set up the state of the IDV (e.g., loading data, displays, etc.)
with the <i>-islinteractive</i>  argument:
<pre>
runIDV capture.isl -islinteractive
</pre>


The  the IDV can  run in &quot;offscreen&quot; mode (see <a
href="/BasicTags.html#isl">more</a>) with an ISL or with Jython.  The
user interface won't be shown. However, the IDV still needs to be run
with an active window system (e.g., X, MS Windows) for it to run.  If
running under a Linux/Unix machine and you don't have an X server
running you need to run the IDV under the X virtual frame buffer:
<i>xvfb</i>.

<p>

The usual mode of use of the ISL is to load in an <a
href="../Bundles.html">IDV bundle</a> which defines the data and
displays that you want captured. In Jython, this is a call to the
<i>loadBundle()</i> method.  As  a convenience, when you go to save a
bundle (e.g., using  the [ug::mmenu File {Save As}] menu), you can
specify a <i>.isl</i> file suffix. When you do this the IDV will write
out both the bundle file and an example ISL file.  It will first
prompt you for some basic ISL information: [ht::cimg images/SaveAs.jpg {Save As ISL Dialog}]

You can, for example, include the text of the bundle file directly
within the ISL file (so you only have one file to deal with). You can
also specify how many iterations of the loop to do and whether  to
create an image and/or a movie.  When using Jython, you would simply
use the feature of the Jython language to accomplish list.
