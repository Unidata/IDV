<div class="overview">
In this section we will briefly cover how to change user preferences.
</div>

<ol class="step">
  <li>Select the [ht::menu Edit  {Preferences}] menu
      item to bring up the [ht::dialog User Preferences] window.
      This window consists of seven tabs.</li>
  
  <li>Select the [ht::command General] tab.</li>
  <ul class="substep">
      <li>The [ht::command Show Dashboard on Start] and 
          [ht::command Show Help Tip Dialog] checkboxes allow you to 
          control what windows are shown automatically.</li>
      
      <li>The [ht::command When Opening a Bundle] section allows you to control
      the behavior of the IDV when a bundle is opened.

      <li> [ht::command Show Windows When They Are Created] controls if 
          the display windows are shown or not when they are not docked
          in the Dashboard.

      <li>As we will discuss later, the [ht::command Resource Sitepath] is one 
          way to specify where to look for application resources. 
	  The command line argument:<br>
          [ht::filename   -sitepath]<br>
          is saved as a user preference.</li>
      
      </ul>

<li> Go to the [ht::command Formats and Data] tab.

<ul>
  <li> Try changing the [ht::command Date Format] and click 
       [ht::command Apply].  Notice that the format of the times
       in the [ht::command Time Animation Widget] and
       [ht::command Display List] changes to the new format.

  <li> Change [ht::command Latitude/Longitude] format to a higher precision, 
       e.g.  &quot;##0.00000&quot; and click [ht::command Apply].  Move
       the cursor around in the view window and notice the precision of
       the  values in the [ht::command Cursor Readout].

  <li> The [ht::command Probe Format] is an html template for displaying 
        data probe results. Try mousing over the text field to show a 
        tooltip that describes the format.

  <li> The [ht::command Distance Unit] is used for controls and
       readouts that use distances. 

  <li> [ht::command Sampling Mode] is used in the displays to determine  
       how grids are sampled.</li>
      
  <li> Tune performance and memory use with the [ht::command Caching], 
       [ht::command Max Image Size] and [ht::command Grid Cache Threshold].

</ul>

    <li>Select the [ht::command View] tab. These are preferences used 
        in the map display to determine clipping, wireframe display, 
        background color, etc.</li>
    
    <ul class="substep">
      <li> Check the  [ht::command Show Display List] option.
      <li> Uncheck the [ht::command Show Times in View] option.
      <li> Set the [ht::command Display List] font to 
           URW Gothic, 14 point.  
      <li>Change the [ht::command Display List] color to white.
      <li>Change the [ht::command Default Projection] to <b>US>CONUS</b>.
      <li>Press [ht::button Apply].  
    </ul>
    
    <li>Select the [ht::command Navigation] tab. This allows 
        you to define different mouse and key bindings. 

    <li>Select the [ht::command Toolbar] tab. This allows you top 
        define what toolbar icons are shown on the toolbar.  This is not
        applied until you restart the IDV.
</ol>
