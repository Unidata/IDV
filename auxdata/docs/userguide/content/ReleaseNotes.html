<faqitem q="Latest netCDF-Java Version" id="nj465">

  <p>
    The version of the netCDF-Java library currently distributed with the IDV is
    the 4.6.11. This is a bug fix release.  See
    the <a href="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/blogs/news/entry/netcdf-java-library-and-tds7">
      netCDF-Java Library</a> for a more details information.

<faqitem q="Isentropic Analysis" id="isentropicana">
  <p>
    For synoptic scale motions, isentropic surfaces are material surfaces. Atmospheric variables tend
    to be better correlated along an isentropic surface upstream/downstream.
    In a 3D visualization space, the new 3D isentropic analysis makes it intuitive to diagnose horizontal
    and vertical motion of the atmosphere, and helps us better understand the dynamic
    and stability of weather phenomenons.
  </p>
</faqitem>

<faqitem q="Scatter Analysis" id="scatterplot">
  <p>
    The IDV constructs scatterplots to illustrate different types of direction and strength of relationships of
    different weather parameters, where the values of one variable are along X axis and the values of the second variable
    are along the Y axis. The new scatter analysis is used to create a scatter plot to study the relationships
    between two 2D parameters. A Scatter analysis also provides statistical information about the data as a whole,
    as well as the subset regions of the data.

<faqitem q="GOES-16 GLM Display" id="goesGLM">
  <p>
    The GLM L2 product consists of geo-located and time-stamped events, groups, and flashes, with
    associated calibrated optical amplitudes (in units of Joules). The IDV has three new data source types:
    GLM EVENT Data files, GLM GROUP Data files, and GLM FLASH Data file to view these three GLM products.

<faqitem q="Grid 3D Surface Smoothing" id="g3dsmooth">
  <p>
    IDV extands the all 2D horizontal smoothing types to 3D gridded parameters. The smoothing is now available
    on 3D displays like isosurfaces of gridded dataset and level2 radar dataset.

<faqitem q="Authentication logic upgraded" id="authlogic">
  <p>
    IDV advances its authentication logic to handle the password changed and/or input wrong password.

<faqitem q="Basic Grid Math" id="mapesbasicmath">
  <p>
    A collection of Utilites from Mapes IDV collection performs a series of basic grid divide, multiply,
    modulo, and vertical derivative.

<faqitem q="3D Scalar Field Horizontal Smoothing" id="mapessmth">
  <p>
    A collection of Utilites from Mapes IDV collection applies a series of horizontal smoothing on 3D field.
  </p>
</faqitem>

<faqitem q="Time Mean and Anomaly" id="mapestimema">
  <p>
    A collection of Utilites from Mapes IDV collection calculates a series of daily, monthly, yearly mean
    and anomaly.
  </p>

  <faqitem q="Publishing to the RAMADDA" id="islpub">
    <p>
      The new ISL publish tag will publish a file to RAMADDA server.
