<ol class="step">

    <li> [ht::clearDisplaysAndData]
    <li> First create two layout models for this exercise.
       <ul>
           <li> Open up the [ht::dialog Layout Model Editor] from the [ht::menu Tools {Layout Models}]  menu.</li>
           <li> Create a [ht::command Shape Symbol] with the shape as [ht::command Sphere],
               double click the symbol to bring up the [ht::dialog Properties Dialog] and set the Foreground Color as
               blue and Scale Size 0.2, and save as [ht::command EarthQuake1]. </li>
           <li> Create another [ht::command Sphere] shape, with [ht::command Foreground Color] set as Clear,
               [ht::command Scale Size By] 0.2, in the [ht::dialog Color By] tab, set [ht::command Map Value of] as
               [ht::param magnitude], and set [ht::command Data Range] 0 and 9, in the [ht::dialog Scale Size]
               tab, set [ht::command Scale By Parameter] as [ht::param magnitude], set [ht::command Data Range]
               0 and 9, and set [ht::command Scale By Factor] 0.3 and 3. Now save this model as
               [ht::command EarthQuake2].</li>
       </ul>
    <li> Load Japan historical earthquake point data.
    <ul>
    <li> [ht::openDataSourceChooser]
    <li>In the [ht::dialog Data Source Chooser] click on the
    [ht::command Files] tab.
    <li> Go to the point data directory:  [ht::filename <%workshop.datadir%>/point/].
    <li> Select [ht::filename IEB-Sendai-region-3000quakes-before-1Mar2011-mags-ge-5.nc]
    <li> Under the [ht::command Data Source Type] pulldown menu, select &quot;Netcdf Point Data files&quot;
    <li> Press [ht::button Add Source]
    <li> Bring up the [ht::dialog Properties] window, and set the [ht::command Bin Size] to 5 years.
    <li> In the [ht::command Fields] panel select [ht::param Point Data].
    <li> Select the [ht::command Layout Model] [ht::param EarthQuake1].
    <li> In the [ht::command Displays] select [ht::display Point Data List] and press
          [ht::button Create Display]
    </ul>

    <li> Modify the displayed setting.

          [ht::command Range] to be [ht::param Start from data] and [ht::param End from animation].
    </ul>

    <li> Load 2011 Japan earthquake point data .
    <ul>
      <li> Load another dataset in the directory [ht::filename IRIS-EB-quakes-Japan-01Mar2011-1201-16Mar2011-530quakes.nc].
      <li> Set the [ht::command Bin Size] to be 5 hours.
      <li> Select the [ht::command Layout Model]  [ht::param EarthQuake2].
      <li> Create Display and repeat the display setting in the previous step.
    </ul>

    <li> Start the Animation.</li>
