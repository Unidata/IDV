<title>Cross Sections of Gridded Data </title>

<div class="overview">
Cross sections of data can be useful to show the variation of
a field along a transect.  In the IDV, a cross section display 
consists of a selector line and display in the main window, 
and a 2D display of the cross section in the control window.</li>
</div>

<ol class="step">

<li>First, we'll create a vertical cross section of contours of wind speed
and compare it to the isosurface made in the previous exercise.  

  <ul class="substep">
    <li>Remove all displays except the isosurface display from the
        previous exercise.  
    <li>In the [ht::dialog Field Selector]'s
        [ht::command Data Sources] panel, select
        the [ht::dataset ETA data source]
        that you loaded at the start of this section.</li>
    <li>In the [ht::command Fields] panel, expand the 
        [ht::param 3D grid] tab. 
        Scroll down to the [ht::param Derived] 
        tab to see a list of derived quantities. Select the 
        [ht::param {Speed (from GridRelative_u &amp; GridRelative_v)}]
        field.
    <li>In the [ht::command Displays] panel, expand the
        Cross Sections tab and select 
        [ht::display Contour Vertical Cross Section] then 
        click the [ht::button Create Display] button.
        You could also create a color-filled contour or color shaded
        vertical cross section, but for the purposes of this exercise,
        we will use the contour cross section.
    <li>Move the cross section selector so it cuts perpendicularly across
        the wind speed core (N-S line through Iowa from Duluth, MN to 
        New Orleans, LA).  You can move the line by clicking and dragging
        the end selector point on the selector line.</li>
    <li>Rotate the main display to the western view.  Zoom in to get
        a better view of the contours.  Note that the 40 m/s contour
        intersects the outer boundary of the isosurface.
<!--
        The contours in the
        cross section are in <b>m/s</b>, but in the previous exercise, 
        we changed the isosurface unit to <b>kt</b>.  Change the
        contours to be in the same unit as the isosurface. Note when
        you do this, the 90 knot contour line intersects the outer
        boundary of the isosurface.</li>
-->
    <li>Bring up the [ht::dialog Contour Properties Editor]
        from the [ht::tab Settings] tab of the control
        window.  Change the contour interval to 5, set the base to 30 and turn 
        on dashing.  Then click the [ht::button OK] button.  
        The display changes so the contours are every 5 m/s and contour lines
        below the base (30) are dashed.</li>
    <li>Start the animation. Note the southward progression of the
        jet core.</li>
    <li>Stop the animation and return the display back to the first
        time in the sequence and the view to the top.</li>
    <li>Remove the isosurface display from the main window.
        Do not remove the cross section display. </li>
        
  </ul>
</li>

<li>You can also create cross sections of 2D parameters that will show
their variation along a transect.  In this step, you will load in a plan
view of sea level pressure and then a data transect of that field.

  <ul class="substep">
    <li>In the [ht::command Fields] panel, expand the 
        [ht::param 2D grid] tab. 
        Select the [ht::param {mean sea level pressure (ETA model reduction)}] 
        field.</li>
    <li>In the [ht::command Displays] panel, select 
        [ht::display Color-Shaded Plan View].  Then, hold the 
        [ht::command Ctrl] key down and click on
        [ht::display Data Transect] to select both. Click
        the [ht::button Create Display] button.</li>
    <li>You should see a color shaded display of sea level pressure
        and a new selector line for the data transect.  Move the
        data transect selector so it spans from high pressure (reds)
        to low pressure (blues).  Note how the display in the 
        control window changes as you move it around.</li>
    <li>You can share the position of cross section selectors between
        two different displays.  In each of the control windows,
        (or by right clicking on the legend for each display)
        select the [ht::menu Edit Sharing] menu and check
        the [ht::menu Sharing On] checkbox.  In the main
        view window, drag one end of the vertical cross section 
        selector slightly.  The selector for the data transect will
        snap to the same position as the vertical cross section line.
    <li>Start the animation.  Is there any relation to the position
        of the jet core and the sea level pressure?</li>
    <li>Stop the animation and return the display back to the first
        time in the sequence and the view to the top.</li>
    <li>Use the [ht::menu Edit {Remove All Displays}] menu or the
        eraser icon in the toolbar [ht::img %dotpath%images/Erase16.gif] 
        to remove the displays created in this exercise.</li>
  </ul>
</li>
