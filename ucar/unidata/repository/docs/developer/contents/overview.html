RAMADDA is organized around a central class 
[class ucar.unidata.repository.Repository]. This class is responsible for
system initialization, receipt and dispatch of incoming http
requests and orchestration of the various manager components.
<p> 
A key design goal of RAMADDA is to limit dependendcies 
from any particular web or database environment.
In the future  we don't know the contexts in which it might run. If we 
design it with core dependencies on a particular database or a particular
web environment it will be very difficult to change. Furthermore,
RAMADDA implements a framework, a domain specific framework for
geoscience oriented content management. 
<p>
The design of RAMADDA is similar to the Tomcat servlet framework in that 
incoming requests are defined with a [class Request] object and the
results are captured in a [class Result] object. However, RAMADDA explicitly 
does not have dependencies on Tomcat or any other framework. This has been
done so that it can run in a wide variety of contexts. It can run stand-alone
with its own built in http server or it can run within Tomcat in a servlet 
context. The [class RepsitoryServer] class (~300 LOC) is the wrapper used 
when running with the stand alone [class ucar.unidata.util.HttpServer] class.
The [class RepositoryServlet] (~400 LOC) class is the wrapper when running
in the Tomcat environment. The only functional difference is that some services
(e.g., OpenDAP) only are available under Tomcat because of their dependencies
on that framework.

<p>
There are a set of [class RepositoryManager] classes that are responsible
for different functional areas:
<ul>
<li> [class DatabaseManager] 
Handles access to the database.
<li> [class AccessManager] 
Manages the access control to entries.
<li> [class HarvesterManager]  
Manages  the set of <a href="#harvester"> [class Harvester] objects</a>.
<li> [class MetadataManager] 
Manages  the set of <a href="#metadatahandler"> [class MetadataHandler] objects</a>.
<li> [class StorageManager] Manages storing data files to disk.
<li> [class UserManager] Manages the users.
<li> [class ActionManager] Used to provide asynchronous 
actions to browser based clients.
</ul>


<h3>Initialization</h3>
The API into RAMADDA is declaratively defined with one or more
api.xml files:
[importxml api.xml]

This file can be organized as a set of group tags that define
a <i>handler</i> and contain a set of <i>api</i>. The api tag
can also define a handler. The handlers are one of: 
usermanager, admin, harvestermanager, actionmanager, accessmanager, metadatamanager, repository.
<p>
External classes can be used as handlers by providing the full
class name. These handlers need to implement [class RequestHandler]
and need to have a public constructor that takes as argument the
Repository object and the xml api Element.
<p>
The api tag contains a <i>path</i> attribute which is used the 
the url path. e.g., the main way to view an entry is the &quot;/entry/show&quot; path. The url ends up looking like:<br> 
&lt;repository suffix&gt;/entry/show?id=&lt;entry id&gt;
</br>
The <i>method</i> attribute is the method name on the handler that is called.
These methods have the signature:
<pre>
public Result processEntryShow(Request request) throws Exception {
    ...
}</pre>

They take a [class Request] object and return a [class Result] object.
