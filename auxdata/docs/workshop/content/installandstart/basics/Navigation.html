<div class="overview">
The mouse and keyboard can be used to zoom, pan and rotate the
view in the <code class="dialog">View Window</code>.
</div>
[ht::popup MouseAndKeyboard.html {(More Info)} -useimg 1]. We'll
go through some simple exercises here to get you used to these
functions. 

<ol class="step">

  <li><b>Zooming</b>
    <ul class="substep">
       <li>Zoom in to a portion of the display using the rubber band feature
           of the IDV.  Hold the <code class="command">Shift</code> key 
           down on the keyboard.
           In the <code class="dialog">View Window</code>, click
           the left mouse button (MB1) and drag the mouse to create a box that 
           covers the region you want to zoom to, and then release the mouse 
           button.</li>

        <li>To restore the display to the full projection, press
            the <code class="command">Ctrl</code> and 
            <code class="command">r</code> keys simultaneously 
            (<code class="command">Ctrl-r</code>).

        <li>You can also zoom by holding the <b>Shift</b> key and the
            right mouse button (MB3) down and move the mouse
            forward and back. Try zooming this way.</li>

        <li>Restore the display to its original position with 
            <code class="command">Ctrl-r</code></li>

        <li>You can also zoom by holding the <code class="command">Shift</code>
            key and pressing
            the up (zoom in) and down (zoom out) arrows on the keyboard.
            You have to click in the window first. Try zooming this way.</li>

        <li>Restore the display to its original position.</li>

        <li>Finally, if you have a mouse with a scroll wheel, you 
            can zoom out by rolling the wheel forward and zoom in
            by scrolling the wheel toward you (e.g. bring the view
            closer).  When you are done, restore the display to its 
            original position.</li>

    </ul>
  </li>

  <li><b>Panning</b>
    <ul class="substep">

        <li>You can pan the display by holding the 
            <code class="command">Ctrl</code> key and the
            right mouse button (MB3) down and move the mouse
            around.  The display will pan in the direction of the
            mouse movement. Try this.</li>

        <li>Restore the display to its original position.
            
        <li>You can also pan the display by holding the 
            <code class="command">Ctrl</code> key and
            pressing the arrow keys on the keyboard.  Using this method,
            the display will pan in the direction of the arrow. Try
            it out. You have to click in the window first.</li>

        <li>Restore the display to its original position.</li>
            
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li><b>Rotating</b>
    <ul class="substep">
       <li>The main view window is configured as a 3-D display.  You
           can rotate the 3-D view by holding down the right mouse button
           (MB3) and moving the mouse.  Try rotating the display
           using this method.  It takes some getting used to.</li>

        <li>Restore the display to its original position.</li>

        <li>You can also rotate the display using the arrow keys on
            the keyboard.  Click in the window and then try using
            the arrow keys to rotate the 3-D box.</li>

        <li>Restore the display to its original position.</li>

        <li>Finally, if you have a scroll wheel on your mouse,
            can use this to rotate the display.  Holding down the
            <code class="command">Ctrl</code> key while scrolling
            will rotate along the Y axis of the display; holding
            the <code class="command">Shift</code> key will rotate
            about the X axis.  Holding the 
            <code class="command">Shift+Ctrl</code> keys at the same
            time will rotate about the Z axis.`
            the keyboard.  Click in the window and then try using
            the arrow keys to rotate the 3-D box.</li>

    </ul>
  </li>


  <li><b>Pulling it all together</b>
        <p>
        Try different combinations of zooming, panning and rotating.  
        When you are finished, restore the display to its original 
        position.
  </li>

  <li><b>Moving Selector Points</b>
    <ul class="substep">
       <li>Some displays have selector points that can be manipulated
       interactively to change their position.</li>
       <li>In the sample data display, move the cursor over the
       endpoint of the red cross section line, click the left mouse button 
       and drag the mouse to move the point.</li>
       <li>Rotate the display to see the change in the cross section in
       the main view window</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

      
  <li> You can change the default behavior through the 
       [ht::command Navigation] tab of the User Preferences accessed
       by the [ht::menu Edit Preferences] menu.
