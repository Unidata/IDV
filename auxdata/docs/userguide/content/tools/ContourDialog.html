The <b>Contour Properties Editor</b> is invoked from any 
contour display control with the <b>Contour: Set</b> button.

Use the items in this window to set contouring properties.

<p><B>Contour Interval</B> determines the spacing 
(difference in value) between contours.   Set it to a single
value to specify a regular interval between contours.  You can 
specify irregular contour intervals with a semi-colon separated
list of the values. For example:
<pre>
       <b>5400;5460;5800</b>
</pre>
would only show the 5400, 5460 and 5800 contour lines.  
<p>
You can also specify different contour intervals for different ranges
with the following syntax:
<pre>
     cint1/min1/max1;cint2/min1/max2;....;cintn/minn/maxn
</pre>
For example, for geopotential heights:<p>
<pre>
     <b>30/0/4200;60/4200/8600;120/8600/24000</b>
</pre>
would draw contours at 30 gpm between 0 and 4200, 60 gpm between
4200 and 8600 and 120 gpm between 8600 and 24000.
<p>
To show a single contour line, specify the contour interval, min
and max as the same value.
For example:
<pre>
    <b>5400/5400/5400</b> 
</pre>
would only show the 5400 line.

<p><B>Base contour</B>  
is the value on which all contours are based. All contours will be
integer multiples of the contour interval from the base value. For
example, with a base value of 0 and a contour interval of 3 contours
would be created at ..-6, -3, 0, 3, 6... A base of 1 with that interval
would create contours at ..-5, -2, 1, 4, 7... The base value need not
be the lowest contour level on a plot, or inside the range of values
plotted; it is only a computational reference point. The base contour
value is also used for controlling which lines are dashed.

<p>

<B>Minimum value</B> is a limit 
below which no contour lines are shown. The minimum may be larger than
the base value, so that the base value may never appear on a plot.

<p><B>Maximum value</B>
is an upper limit above which no contour lines are shown. The minimum
and maximum values need not match contour line values; they are only
limits.

<p><B>Line width</B>
sets the line width (in pixels) of the contour lines and labels.

<p>

If <B>Dash</B> is checked, values less than the base value are dashed.
If base is set higher than maximum value, then all lines are dashed.  You
can set the dash line style using the selection widget.

<p>

You can toggle the labels by clicking the <B>Labels</B> check box.
You can set the font, font size, label alignment and label frequency
using the widgets.  The default values for these can be set in the
<a href="Preferences.html">User Preferences</a> under the View tab.

<p>


Click on <B>OK</B> to set the values you want and close this window. 
Click <b>Apply</b> to set the values but leave this window open.
