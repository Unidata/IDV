RAMADDA has a plugin facility that enables one to add new kinds of entry types, new content views, etc. In the RAMADDA home directory there is a &quot;plugins&quot; sub-directory. When RAMADDA starts up it loads all of the files in the plugins directory. 
<p>
There is a listing of available plugins at:
<a href="http://motherlode.ucar.edu/repository/alias/ramaddaplugins">http://motherlode.ucar.edu/repository/alias/ramaddaplugins</a>. To install a plugin just download the file and copy it to the RAMADDA home directory <i>plugins</i> directory.


<h3>How plugins work</h3>
RAMADDA determines what to do with a plugin file by looking at its file name. If the file is a jar file it will crack open the jar file and look at each contained file. It handles the files in the following way:
<ul>
<li> <i>.properties</i><br>
Any &quot;.properties&quot; files are loaded as  system properties.

<li> <i>.class</i><br> 
Any .class file is loaded via a classloader. Some classes are special:
<ul>
<li>
 If the class is an instanceof a ucar.unidata.repository.auth.UserAuthenticator then the class is instantiated and it is used to handle user login and authentication.
<li> If the class is an instanceof ucar.unidata.repository.AdminHandler then the class is instantiated. You can use this to add new apis into the repository and to add admin configuration options. Note: this is a work in progress.
</ul>

<li><i>api.xml</i><br>
If the file ends with &quot;api.xml&quot; then it defines new web application apis. 
<li><i>types.xml</i><br>
If the file ends with &quot;types.xml&quot; it defines new repository entry types.
<li><i>outputhandlers.xml</i><br>
If the file ends with &quot;outputhandlers.xml&quot; it defines new output handlers.
<li><i>metadata.xml</i><br>
If the file ends with &quot;metadata.xml&quot; it defines new metadata types.
<li><i>.py</i><br>
If the file ends with &quot;.py&quot; then it defines new jython routines that are loaded into any jython interpreter (e.g., used by the repository script entry type).
<li><i>.sql</i><br> 
If the file ends with &quot;.sql&quot; then the file is evaluated at startup to define new database schemas.

</ul>
