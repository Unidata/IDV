The Jython Library window has a tree view on the left that shows the different
(categorized) library files available. The files that are listed under &quot;Local Jython&quot;
are those that you can edit. The  System files  cannot be edited.
On the right is the edit pane for the selected file. 
<p>
There is documentation  available for the <a href="JythonLib.html">System Jython Libraries</a>.

<faqitem q="How does Jython work with my data in the IDV">
The IDV uses the <a href="http://www.ssec.wisc.edu/~billh/visad.html">VisAD</a> package as 
as an underlying data model.
There is a <a href="http://www.ssec.wisc.edu/~tomw/visadtutor/">VisAD/Jython Tutorial</a> available.
There is also an <a href="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/idv/docs/workshop/formulas/index.html">IDV Workshop Section</a> on writing Jython.

<faqitem q="I don't like editing in this editor. How do I use  my own editor.">
You can use this edit window or, 
optionally you can define the path to an external text editor (e.g., emacs, vi, etc.) 
through the main <a href="Preferences.html">User Preferences</a>. Once defined there will be a File menu entry
in the Jython Library &quot;Edit in External Editor&quot;. The file that is being edited is monitored by the IDV
and, when it is saved by the external editor is loaded and checked for correct syntax. When the external editor exits
the file is reinserted into the internal IDV editor.

<p>

When you save the file thought the external editor or the IDV editor the code is checked
for valid Jython syntax;  If there is an
error, a pop-up window will appear with an error message.
The actual error will also be printed in the console window running the IDV. Correct the error and
try to save again. 


</faqitem>

<faqitem q="Creating/Removing library files">
To create  a new file uses the [ht::menu File {New Jython Library...}] menu. To remove the currently displayed
library file use the [ht::menu File {Remove Library}] menu. 
</faqitem>

<faqitem q="Calling procedures from formulas">

When creating a formula with the <a href="Formulas.html">Formula Editor</a>
you can call any routines you have defined in the Jython Library
Simply enter the procedure name in the formula, with
appropriate arguments, if any. For example a formula might be
&quot;convertCToF(atemp)&quot;.  When evaluating  the formula for display,
this will cal the routine that you define in the Jython Library.


</faqitem>
<faqitem q="Create a formula from my procedure">
Right click on a procedure definition within the IDV editor window and choose 
[ht::menu {Make formula for ...}]. This is a convenience that brings up
the  Formula creation dialog with a call to that procedure.

<p>

Also, as another convenience you can right click to shw the [ht::menu {Insert Procedure Call}] menu. This
lists all of the currently defined procedures in the other Jython libraries.
