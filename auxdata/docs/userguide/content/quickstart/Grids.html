This section describes how to make plots from gridded data sets.
The set of steps involve:

<subhead id="connecting" intoc="false">Connecting to a Data Source on a Remote Server</subhead>


In the <a href="../data/choosers/index.html">Data Chooser</a> select the
<b>Catalogs</b> tab.   

[ht::cimg ../data/choosers/images/CatalogChooser.gif]

Choose one of the remote <b>Catalogs:</b> 
such as  <b>http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/georesources/idvcatalog.xml</b>
for Unidata's catalog of near real-time model output.

<p>

A tree view of the catalog will be displayed. Open one, such
as the &quot;NCEP NAM 80km CONUS model data (real and near time)&quot;, 
by clicking on one of the tab icons 
(<img src=../data/images/TreeTagClosed.gif alt="icon">).

<p>

The list of this model's run times appears. Click on one time to select
it, and then click on the <b>Add Source</b> button. You have selected
this model run's output to be accessible by the IDV. 

<subhead id="selecting" intoc="false">Selecting the display to be
made</subhead>


The gridded data source that you selected will be shown in the
<a href="../data/FieldSelector.html">Field Selector window</a>.
In the <b>Fields</b> panel are folders of data categorized as 2D and 3D fields.
Click on the 2D grid tab (<img src=../data/images/TreeTagClosed.gif alt="icon">)
to expand that category list. A list of all 2D grid
parameters in the data source appears. 
When one of the fields is selected the list of applicable displays will be
shown. For a complete list of example displays, see 
<a href="../examples/index.html">Example Displays</a>.

<p> Try creating a Contour Plan View by selecting that display
in the list and clicking on the <b>Create Display</b> button.
The display will be created and shown in the main window. The
display's legend should also be shown. You can bring up the <a
href="../controls/PlanViewControl.html">control window</a> by right
clicking on the name in the legend and selecting 
[ug::menu {Control Window}] from the popup menu.

[ht::cimg images/SLPContours.gif]

<subhead id="3dplot" intoc="false">To make a plot of 3D data</subhead>

Click on the 3D grid tab to expand that category. A list of all 3D grid
parameters appears. To make a plot, first  click on a
parameter name such as "Geopotential height at isobaric levels."

<p>
Display types suitable for this parameter are listed in then
<b>Displays</b> panel.
Select Contour Plan View and click on the 
[ht::command Create Display] button.


<p>
The initial plot is at the lowest  level in the data grid, such as 
1000 millibar in this example. To shift the level to other levels:
<ul>
<li>Right click on the legend (such as "T Contour Plan
View Level 1000") to get a pop-up menu.
<li>Click on [ug::menu {Control Window}]
to bring up this display's Control window

<li>In the Control window
click on the <b>Levels:</b> box to bring up the pop-up menu of
native grid levels in the data
<li>select the desired level, such as 500, from the list.
</ul>
The plot will move to 500 millibars. 

<p>
To zoom, rotate or pan this 3D
display, see <a href="../ui/Navigation.html">Zoom, Rotate, and
Pan</a>. Rotate the display by dragging with the right mouse button.
(you see that the 500 millibar contours are above the surface).
The key combination Ctrl-R will restore the display to the original
overhead view.

 
<p>
To toggle on the time animation loop, use the Run/Stop 
icon in the animation control. Read more about 
<a href="../ui/Animation.html#animation">Time Animation Widget</a>.

<p>
To remove an existing
display, use the [ug::menu File {Remove Display}] menu of the
display's control window or the popup menu.

<subhead id="subset" intoc="false">Subsetting Times</subhead>

The IDV automatically loads data for all data times selected in the data
selection step, and loads them as displays for an animation
loop. Creating several displays may take time. If you only need
to see one data time, it is better to only create displays for that time.


<p>

To make time selections that apply to all data in one data
source,  double click on the data source name in the left panel
of the Field Selector window to bring up the 
<a href="../data/DataSourceProperties.html">Data Source Properties</a> editor.  Click on the [ug::tab Times] tab to subset the times.

[ht::cimg ../data/images/DataSourceTimes.gif]

Initially all times are selected for display by the IDV - indicated by
the times in this window being grayed out and the box "Use All" being
checked. To limit the selection to fewer times than all times, first
check off the box "Use All." Then select the times you want to use by
clicking on the times (note: you can select multiple times with the
<i>Shift</i> and <i>Control</i> keys).

<p>

To make time selections for one field, use the <b>Times</b> selector in
the lower right panel of the Field Selector, under the <b>Displays</b> 
panel, after you select the field, and before you create the display.  
This will override the default times for the data source.

<subhead id="spatialsubset" intoc="false">Spatial Subsetting</subhead>
You can also spatially subset the grid using the 
[ug::tab Spatial Subset] tab of the Data Source Properties or
the Field Selector.  This works similar to the times subsetting where
you can set the property for all fields in the Data Source or 
override the default for a particular field.
<p>
For more information on time and spatial subsetting, see the
<a href="../data/DataSourceProperties.html">Data Source Properties</a>
page of this User's Guide.
