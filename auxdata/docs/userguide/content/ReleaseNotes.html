<faqitem  id="j8282" q="OpenJDK Java Version">

  <p>
    Due to the end of Oracle Java free release updates, the IDV project has
    officially moved from Oracle JDK to OpenJDK packages that receives support via the
    community. The AdoptOpenJDK provides prebuilt binaries from OpenJDK class libraries. All AdoptOpenJDK
    binaries and scripts are open source licensed and available for free. The version of the
    AdoptOpenJDK distributed with the IDV is 1.8.0_282. See
    the <a href=https://adoptopenjdk.net/> adoptOpenJDK Library</a> for a more details information.

<faqitem id="cert" q="IDV Certifcates and Notarization">

  <p>
    Java Webstart, Windows app and MacOS certificates have been renewed and will
    be valid until at least May 30, 2020 (MacOS certificate is valid until
    2024). Moreover, as properly signing the IDV under these different
    environments can be an involved process, this information has thoroughly
    <a href="https://github.com/Unidata/IDV/blob/master/release/certs.md">documented
    here</a>. The IDV MacOS installer in this release has been notarized by Apple in order to run by default on MacOS.

<faqitem id="gridcoveragetype" q="Grid Coverage and Cross Boundary Subset" >
  <p>
    The cross boundary subset in the grid coverage type works similar to the grid file subset where
    you can set the property for subset all fields in the Data Source Property panel or you can
    override the default setting for a particular
    field in the field selector subset panel. The only difference in the Coverage data spatial subset is
    that it will allow users to flip longitudes in a cyclic rect linear grid from 0/360 to -180/180 (or vice-versa)
    before performing the cross boundary subset.

<faqitem id="volumerenderdisplay" q="New Volume Rendering">
  <p>
    New enhanced volume rendering display applies linear 3D re-sampling and stack 2D algorithm to enhance the
    texture of the volume rendering display.
  </p>
</faqitem>

<faqitem id="texthtmldisplay" q="Text Html Display">
  <p>
    New enhanced Text/Html display avaiable under Displays > Special for displaying straight text or HTML, the display
    can be added to the view window legend panel for descriptive text about the display.
  </p>
</faqitem>

<faqitem id="displayimagequality" q="Image Capture Quality">
  <p>
    When doing the image capture we replaced the original screen capture APIs with Java Canvas3D “OffScreenRendering”
    to improve the image quality. Keep Java Robot screen capture APIs only when the IDV legend and Full window is needed.
    Replaced JPEG with PNG as the base image format for the animated movie.

<faqitem id="display3Dcross" q="3D Cross Layout Model">
  <p>
    3D cross draws a symbol for a location point indication, it is a very simple graphic elements and
    the large numbers of symbols can be displayed with it. 3D cross symbol can be colored by the value of numerical attribute
    of the location.

<faqitem id="scallopedline" q="Scalloped Line Display">
  <p>
    Scalloped line draws boundaries for the significant weather chart. This new drawing feature has been added to the drawing control
    and could be applied to the demarcation of significant weather.

<faqitem cat="Jython Changes"></faqitem>


<faqitem id="timestepAccuformulas" q="Time step Precipitation Accumulation Formulas">
  <p>
    The new GFS dataset collection has mixed accumulation hours in the time axis for each time step and the
    previous logic in the IDV picks the first one in the list, unfortunately, always the longest one.
    So the new logic will try to pick the shortest accumulation hour for each time step, and what we
    got are 3 and 6 hours for GFS one degree or 0.25 degree, we can use the subtraction
    to get the 3-hour time step accumulation. This change has been added as a derived variable named:
    TimeStepAccumulatedPrecip. In general, this formula can be applied to other mixed interval parameters.
