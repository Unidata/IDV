<div class="overview">
The IDV can read in point observation data in Comma Separated Value (CSV) form (as well as tab separated values and Excel xls files).
</div>

<p>
<ul class="step">

    <li> Here is an example file: <a target="_other" href="metar.csv.txt">metar.csv</a>.
    The minimum data required by the IDV is time, latitude and longitude.

    <li> Load the csv file in.
    <ul>
     <li> In the [ht::dialog Data Source Chooser] click on the
         [ht::command Files] tab.
     <li> Go to the point data directory:     [ht::filename <%workshop.datadir%>/point/].
     <li> Select [ht::filename metar.csv] and press  [ht::button Add Source].
     </ul>

     <li> The Text Point Metadata Gui will pop up.    This allows you to define the metadata for the point data.

    <li>Using the Text Point Metadata Gui
    <ul>
    <li> At the top a number of the initial lines from the text data are shown.
         The arrow buttons allow you to specify where the data starts. Skip the first line.

    <li> For each column of text data there is a row that shows sample value and allows you to enter a name, unit, date format, missing
        value and extra information. 

    <li> We're going to skip the &quot;ROW&quot; parameter and define metadata for:<br>
        &quot;Time &quot;,&quot;Latitude&quot;, &quot;Longitude&quot;, &quot;T&quot;,
        &quot;DIR&quot;,and &quot;SPD&quot;.

    <li> Note that the time field spans two columns - year and time. The IDV needs to have the time in one column so we use:<br>
<i>colspan="2"</i><br>
This tells the IDV to concatenate columns 1 and 2 and treat them as a single column.

    <li> Note: the unit for longitude is &quot;degrees_west&quot;
   
    <li> Enter the names and units as shown above.

    <li> You can save these settings for future use.
     <ul>
       <li> 
       Press the [ht::button Preferences] button and select  [ht::menu {Save Current}]. 
       <li> Enter a name, e.g., &quot;workshop&quot;
       <li> You can reapply these settings with the [ht::button Preferences] button.
      </ul>

     <li> When done press [ht::button OK]. You can also bring up this GUI in the Data Source Properties Dialog.

    </ul>


    <li> Create the [ht::display Point Data Plot] and change its layout model to &quot;METAR&quot;




    <li> You can also add a special 2 line header to the top of your text file.

In the example above, the first line's structure is a VisAD type definition.
The second line defines the formatting and units of the parameters.
Starting the third line is the data section of this sample.
