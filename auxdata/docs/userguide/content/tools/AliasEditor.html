The Parameter Alias Editor is  opened through the
<a href="../ui/Menus.html#tools">Tools menu</a>
with 
[ug::menu Tools  {Parameter Alias Editor}]  menu
and allows for the  association
between "canonical" parameter names used by the IDV for physical
quantities, such as TEMP for
temperature, and  parameter names used in particular  data
sets for the same quantity, such as for example "jan_mean_temp."

Different data sets often have different names for the same
physical quantity, such as for 
the quantities temperature or easterly wind speed component.
You can make the IDV recognize any particular data name as representing a
standard quantity. The <b>Alias Editor</b> associates
any particular variable name that may appear in a data set (right
column) with a canonical or IDV name or alias (left column). 
<p>
The Alias Editor has a number of tabs that display the user editable
aliases and the non-editable system aliases.
You can right click on a row in the system alias tab to copy that row
to the user's tab. You can also add a new alias with the
[ug::button New Alias] button. You can edit a user's entry
by right clicking on the table row.
<p>
When you do this the alias properties  dialog is shown where you can
edit the name, label (descriptive text) and the aliases:
