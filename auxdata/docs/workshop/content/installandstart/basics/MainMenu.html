<div class="overview">
In this exercise, we explore some of the items in the main
menu bar of the IDV.  
</div>

<p>The main menu bar is accessible from either
the <code class="dialog">View Window</code> or the
<code class="dialog">Dashboard</code> window.  Detailed
information on each item in the main menu bar can be found
in the <a href="%urlroot%/docs/userguide/ui/Menus.html" target="userguide">IDV User's Guide</a>.

<div class="cimg"><img src="images/MainMenuBar.gif" ></div>

For this exercise, we will look at the [ht::menu File] and
[ht::menu Help] menus.  The other menus will be explored in
subsequent exercises.

<div class="pagesubtitle">The File Menu</div>

<div class="cimg"><img src="images/FileMenu.gif" ></div>

The <code class="menu">File</code> menu is used for opening new 
<code class="dialog">View Window</code>s, restoring the 
<code class="dialog">Dashboard</code>, importing and exporting 
<glossary word="bundle">bundles</glossary> and exiting the IDV. 
As a simple exercise, we will close the <code class="dialog">Dashboard</code>
and then open a new one, since this is a common function.</li>

<ol class="step">

  <li>Close the <code class="dialog">Dashboard</code> window by
      clicking on the <b>X</b> in the title bar of the window.</li>

  <li>Open a new <code class="dialog">Dashboard</code> by
      selecting the [ht::menu File New {View Window} Windows Dashboard] menu
      item.</li>
</ol>

We'll look at other portions of the [ht::menu File] menu in
subsequent exercises.

<div class="pagesubtitle">The Help Menu</div>

The <code class="menu">Help</code> menu is used to access the
incorporated documentation and other features that provide
information about the IDV.  

<div class="cimg"><img src="images/HelpMenu.gif" ></div>

<ol class="step">

  <li>First, let's look at the User's Guide.  Select the 
      [ht::menu Help {User's Guide}] menu item to bring up the IDV User's Guide.

  <li>You can select any topic in the navigation pane at the
      left side of the viewer.  For example, expand the 
      <code class="param">Appendix</code> tab, then the 
      <code class="param">Examples of Display Types</code> tab and select
      the <code class="param">Flow Displays</code> entry in the
      list to view that page.</li>

   <li>Now, use the [ht::menu Help {Zooming, Panning and Rotating}] menu
       item in the main menu bar of the IDV to go to the page that
       provides an overview of mouse and keyboard use.
       <popup label="">
       The items in the top part of the <code class="command">Help</code>
       menu are shortcuts into relevant sections of the User's Guide.
       </popup>
       </li>

  <li>Close the <code class="dialog">IDV User's Guide</code> window by
      clicking on the <b>X</b> in title bar of the window.</li>

  <li>Now, let's bring the <code class="dialog">Help Tips</code>
      window back up by selecting the [ht::menu Help {Show Help Tips}]
      menu item.  The help tips in this window are designed to give
      you some tips on using the IDV and quick access to sections
      of the User's Guide.  Click the 
      <code class="button">Next</code> button until you get to
      the <b>Zooming, Panning, and Rotating</b> tip.  Click on the link to
      bring up the User's Guide section on this topic.</li>

   <li>Uncheck the <code class="command">Show tips on startup</code>
       checkbox and then click the <code class="button">Close</code>
       button.  The next time you start the IDV, the 
       <code class="dialog">Help Tips</code> window will not 
       automatically pop up.</li>

   <li>There are several items in the [ht::menu Help] menu that are
       useful if you are having problems and need to contact
       Unidata User Support.  The [ht::menu Help {Show Console}]
       menu item brings up the IDV console where all error messages
       are shown.   Another important menu is the
       [ht::menu Help {About...}] menu which lists the version
       of the IDV that you are running.  You should always
       indicate the version when you contact Unidata User Support 
       with any problems you may have.  Lastly, if you are having
       problems with the IDV, the [ht::menu Help {Support Request Form...}]
       menu allows you to submit a problem report directly to
       Unidata.  This should be used as a last resort after you
       have followed all the recommended steps in the User's Guide
       <a href="%urlroot%/docs/userguide/Support.html" target="userguide">
       Documentation and Support</a>.  Be sure to fill in all the 
       fields and most importantly to provide a detailed description
       of the problem.

</ol>

Now, let's look at the <code class="menu">View</code> and 
<code class="menu">Projections</code> menus
in the <code class="dialog">View Window</code>.
