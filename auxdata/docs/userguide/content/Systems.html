The IDV should run on any platform that fully supports <b>Java 7</b> and <b>Java
3D</b> and has been tested by Unidata on <b>Windows, Linux, Solaris x86, Mac
OS X</b>.

<p> For reasonable performance, it is recommended that an Intel system running
IDV have at least a <b>1.2 GHz processor and 1 GB memory (RAM)</b>. Performance
will be even better with faster processors and more memory. Detailed
requirements are listed below.</p>

<subhead id="os" intoc="false">Operating Systems and Java Versions</subhead>

The IDV runs on any platform that supports:
<ul>
<li><b>Java</b> version 1.7 or higher
<li><b>Java 3D</b> version 1.6 (including pre-release versions).
</ul>
<p>

The IDV is known to run on the following operating systems:<p>

<table border="1">
<tr><th>OS</th><th>Version</th></tr>
<tr><td><b>Windows</b></td><td>XP, Vista, 7, 8</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>Linux</b></td><td>Most modern flavors of Linux</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>Mac OS-X</b></td><td>10.7 or later</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>Solaris/x86</b></td><td>Solaris 10, 11 (Intel)</td></tr>
</table>

Your graphics system must support Open GL, and for X Window Systems, GLX.

<subhead id="disk" intoc="false">Disk Space</subhead>

You will need about 150 MB disk space for the installer file, which will
uncompress into about twice that size. These include Java and Java3D.


<subhead id="memory" intoc="false">System Memory and Processor Speed</subhead>

The IDV can be demanding of hardware speed and memory depending on the
size of the datasets you wish to work with. It is recommended that
the system have a <b>minimum</b> of 512 MB of RAM free for IDV use.
Performance is significantly better with 1 GB RAM or more.

<p>

Recommended processor speed will vary by platform, but in general, the faster
the processor, and the more memory your system has, the better IDV performance
will be.

<subhead id="video" intoc="false">Graphics Cards</subhead>
The IDV works on systems with graphics cards that support OpenGL (all systems).
In most cases, you should make sure you have the latest video driver for your
system.  Even if the system is brand new, the video driver may be old.
<p>

<subhead id="network" intoc="false">Internet Connection for Downloading 
the IDV, and for Data Sources</subhead>

You will have to download some 100-150 MB of IDV software which provide Java and
Java3D.

<p>

The IDV is designed to access data on remote servers on the Internet, as well as
from local files. Downloading data from remote servers benefits from a fast
connection to the Internet, since many data fields are large.

<p>
There are several ports you need open at your institution in order to run the
IDV so that it may connect to different data servers. In general, ports 112,
8080 and 80 are required.
