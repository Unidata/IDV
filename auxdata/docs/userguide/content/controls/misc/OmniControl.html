The Omni control is a VisAD Spread Sheet, loaded with the 
parameter selected and its coordinates and units. The Spread Sheet is
used to create a display where you have complete control over which
coordinates are the axes, how it is colored, and so on.  
Use of the VisAD Spread Sheet is not described here. See the VisAD 
Spread Sheet document at https://www.ssec.wisc.edu/~curtis/ss.html.
