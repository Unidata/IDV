When you invoke <b>Help</b> from a menu or a dialog in the IDV, the
appropriate section of the User's Guide is displayed in a help
viewer window. 

<p>

The large area on the right side is the content pane (9 in figure below)
that shows the help text, and to its left is the navigation pane (1)
that shows the help contents; clicking on an item in the navigation pane
puts its contents into the content pane. Features of this window are
described below:

<ul>

<p><b>1</b> is the navigation pane. Click on any item listed here to see
the corresponding help in the content pane, 9. Click on a file icon to
see sub-category choices.

<p><b>2</b> and <b>3</b> are "back" and "forward" buttons like in a web
browser. 

<p><b>4</b> prints the current page if your printer is set up properly.

<p><b>5</b> is a tab to see a table of contents in the navigation
pane. This is the initial setting; and is also used after a search (next).

<p><b>6</b> invokes the search feature of Java Help. You can enter a
word or words and search the entire User's Guide for them.

<p><b>7</b> shows the left-pointing arrowhead which 
expands the content pane to fill the entire viewer window.

<p><b>8</b> restores the navigation pane if it was hidden with 7.

</ul>

<p>

<b>Note:</b> The help viewer is a simple HTML file browser and is intended
to display only the IDV User Guide documentation. It does not support 
advanced features of pages on some web sites (e.g., JavaScript).  
Since some of the IDV User's Guide pages include links to pages outside 
of the IDV help documents, these links may be displayed incorrectly or 
not at all if they use any advanced features.
