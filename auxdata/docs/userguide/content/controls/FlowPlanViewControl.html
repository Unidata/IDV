{Flow Plan Control}


{

The Flow Plan View Control is used to control plan (horizontal)
displays (flow vectors, wind barbs, streamlines) of
vector based data (e.g., wind components). It is similar
to the <a href="PlanViewControl.html">Plan View controls</a>.
You can toggle between the vector and streamlines view and control
the vector size, color and skip interval.
