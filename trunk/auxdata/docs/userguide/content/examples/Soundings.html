The meteorological sounding display is available with a choice
of thermodynamic diagrams (skew-T, Stuve and Emagram), with a
table of related aerological parameters.

A sounding diagram can be made for any point inside a data grid
of numerical weather prediction model output with temperature and
humidity (the dew-point temperature is computed by Unidata code from
temperature and relative humidity grids), or from balloon soundings
(RAOBs). The sounding display and its table and controls appear in a
separate window. To learn more about the aerological displays see the <a
href="../controls/AerologicalSoundingControl.html">Sounding Display</a>.
