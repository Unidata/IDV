<h3>Vertical Cross Sections</h3>

The three figures above show the same data and same cross section position
in three different kinds of 
vertical cross section displays.

IDV vertical cross sections are  
displayed in both  the main 3D  display and
in the Vertical Cross Section  Control window, with either 
contour lines or as a colored image. 

<p>

Note in the above figure that "shaded" displays in cross sections 
and other IDV displays can be used to show data values in grid cells by color.

<p>

Contour lines may be colored by value to
coordinate with other displays, or to help distinguish them from
other lines in the window. A cross-section can be moved to any location by dragging the end points.   Interpolation is used to estimate the
  data values in the cross-section from the gridded data values which
  do not lie on the actual cross section plane. 

<p>

To learn how to make a display, see
<a href="../quickstart/Grids.html">Getting Started: Plots from Gridded Data</a> 
and
<a href="../data/FieldSelector.html">the Data Selector Window</a>.
  You can control the display appearance with the associated
  <a href="../controls/CrossSectionControl.html">
Vertical Cross Section Control</a>.
You can make more than one vertical cross-section, for one or more
  parameters, and by moving the end positions create a single cross-section
  of several segments at different azimuths.
 







<h3>Data Transect Display</h3>
 
The Data Transect is a display of values from a 2D (x-y or lat-lon to value) 
data field along a line across the field.
Select "Data Transect" for 
Display type for any 2D data of this kind, such as model
output in 2D grids, and DEM data. You can move the transect line in the main 
IDV display by dragging with the left mouse button.
