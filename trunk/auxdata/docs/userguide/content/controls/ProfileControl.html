{Vertical Profile Control}


{
The Vertical Profile display control shows a  plot
of any number of field values versus altitude.
The point that is being probed is shown in the main display.
You can drag that point around to resample different areas.



You can add new fields to show with the
[ug::menu Edit {Add Parameter...}] menu.

See <a href="Chart.html">here</a> for more information about customizing the chart.
