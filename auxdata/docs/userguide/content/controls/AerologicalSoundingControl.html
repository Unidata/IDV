{Sounding Display}


{

The meteorological sounding display is available  for:
<ul>

<li>RAOBs (balloon soundings)

<li>numerical weather prediction model output with
temperature and humidity. The dew-point temperature is computed by
internal code from temperature and relative humidity grids.

<li>from a local file that contains aircraft track data. 
</ul>


To load sounding data see <a
href="../data/choosers/RaobChooser.html">Choosing
a RAOB Data Source from a Remote Server</a> and <a
href="../data/choosers/CatalogChooser.html">Choosing a Gridded Data
Source from a Remote Server</a>.

<p>

The IDV Sounding Display includes an aerological (thermodynamic)
diagram (e.g., Skew-T, Stuve, Emagram), a table of related aerological
parameters, a hodograph and a table readout of the data.

<p>

The hodograph display is enabled if the plotted data includes
wind fields.  You can rotate the display to see the vertical
structure as well as the horizontal structure of the winds.

<p>

The Table tab shows the data in table form:

[ht::cimg images/GridSoundingTableGui.gif {The Sounding Table View}]

<p>


A label at the top of the sounding window shows the latitude-longitude
position of the sounding. RAOB station location is shown on the main
IDV display as a small colored square. When displaying sounding plots
made from gridded model output, the position of the sounding is shown in
the main 3D view window by a solid-color selector point and vertical
line. You can move this model-output-based sounding position over the map
by dragging the selector point with the left button.

<p>

When displaying a sounding diagram made from model output, you can use the
time animation control to step through the time sequence.

See more about the animation control in 
<a href="../ui/Animation.html">Animation Control</a>.

<p>
To increase precision using the sounding diagram, enlarge the window
by dragging on the edges. You can zoom the sounding diagram by holding
down the Shift key and dragging the right button upwards; drag downwards
to zoom out. You can pan the diagram by dragging the mouse pointer in
any direction while pressing the right mouse button.

<p>

The temperature and dew-point traces can be modified via the cursor.
Press the left button on the first data-point to be modified and drag it
horizontally along an isobar to the desired position, then move the
pointer diagonally along an isotherm to keep the data-point at the
desired position and to pick-up the next data-point.  Repeat until
done and then release the mouse button.

<p>

The <b>Parcel Path</b>  checkbox allows for the selection of  the origin of the path
of a parcel of air lifted pseudo-adiabatically from the initial point to
the top of the diagram. Check <b>Parcel path</b> to display the path of
a lifted parcel.


<p>

The  <b>Virtual Temperature</b>  checkbox controls whether
or not the virtual temperatures of the environmental profile and
pseudo-adiabatically lifted air-parcel are displayed.

<p>

The  <b>Grid Points</b>  checkbox controls turns on the display of the grid
points in the main display.


<p>

The <b>Parcel Mode</b> menu allows for the specification of
how the initial conditions of the pseudo-adiabatically lifted air-parcel
(i.e. the parcel's pressure, temperature, and moisture content at
the start of the pseudoadiabatic lifting) are determined from the
environmental sounding (i.e. the temperature and dew-point profiles
according to the mode indicated by . 
choices are:
<ul>
<li> <b>Bottom of Sounding</b>.
The initial conditions of the parcel are determined
from the temperature and dew-point at the lowest (i.e. highest pressure)

<li> <b>Below Cursor</b>
The initial conditions of the parcel are
determined from the temperature and dew-point profiles by computing
the pressure-weighted mean potential temperature and water-vapor
mixing-ratio of the atmosphere that lies below the cursor when the
middle mouse button is pressed. Thus, pressing the middle button at 950
hPa for a sounding that starts at 1000 hPa will effectively mix the
lower 50 hPa of the atmosphere and lift the resulting parcel starting at
975 hPa.

<li> <b>At Cursor Pressure</b>.
The initial pressure, in-situ
temperature, and moisture content of the parcel are taken from the
temperature and dew-point profiles at the pressure of the cursor when
the middle mouse button is pressed. In <b>At Cursor (Press, Temp)</b>
mode, the initial pressure and in-situ temperature of the parcel equal
the pressure and temperature values under the cursor when the middle
mouse button is pressed. The initial moisture content is determined from
the dew-point profile at the initial pressure.

<li> <b>At Cursor (Press, Temp)</b>.
The computed path of a lifted parcel is automatically updated when
appropriate. In both <b>Below Cursor</b>, <b>At Cursor Pressure</b>, and
<b>At Cursor (press, temp)</b> modes, the path will update as the cursor
is dragged. In all modes, the path will update whenever the profiles
change.

</ul>

<p>

The  <b>Consecutive Profiles</b>  checkbox controls turns on the display of two profiles
consecutive in time. The dash line is for the earlier time step, and the solid line is for
the later time step. This allows user to compare the stability change in the atmosphere. If the
pair of the profiles not consecutive in time and you want to do the comparison, you need to
remove those time steps between them through the field selector data subset panel.

<p>
The [ug::menu Customize] menu allows the user to control what is shown
in the display (e.g., Dry Adiabats, Saturation Adiabats, Saturation Mixing Ratios)
and to switch the diagram type between Skew-T, Stuve and Emagram.

<div class="pagesubtitle">RAOB Sounding Control</div>

The RAOB Sounding Control adds a [ug::menu Sounding] menu to allow for the selection 
of the sounding to display:

<p>

Click on the <b>Stations</b> check-box in the lower right corner to
toggle visibility of the RAOB station location mark in the main display
window.




<div class="pagesubtitle">Aerological Parameters</div>

The table to the left of the sounding diagram contains aerological
parameters determined from the atmospheric sounding displayed in the
diagram.  The following abbreviations are used:

  <dl>
    <dt>LCL</dt>
    <dd>
      Lifting Condensation Level: the level at which a
      pseudo-adiabatically lifted air-parcel becomes saturated with
      water-vapor.
    </dd>
    <dt>LFC</dt>
    <dd>
      Level of Free Convection: the level at which the virtual
      temperature of a pseudo-adiabatically lifted air-parcel changes
      from being less than the environment's virtual temperature to
      being greater than the environment's.
    </dd>
    <dt>LNB</dt>
    <dd>
      Level of Neutral Buoyancy: the level above the LFC at which the
      virtual temperature of a pseudo-adiabatically lifted air-parcel
      equals the environment's virtual temperature.
    </dd>
    <dt>CAPE</dt>
    <dd>
      Convective Available Potential Energy: the area between the
      virtual temperature trace of the pseudo-adiabatically lifted
      air-parcel and the virtual temperature trace of the environment
      from the LFC to the LNB in which the parcel's virtual temperature
      is greater than the environment's (positive CAPE connotes
      convective development).
    </dd>
    <dt>CIN</dt>
    <dd>
      Convective Inhibition: the negative of the area between the
      virtual temperature trace of the pseudo-adiabatically lifted
      air-parcel and the virtual temperature trace of the environment
      from the parcel's initial conditions to the LFC in which the
      parcel's virtual temperature is less than the environment's
      (negative CIN connotes initial positive work to lift the parcel).
