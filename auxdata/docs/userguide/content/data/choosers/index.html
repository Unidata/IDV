The IDV can use data from local files, remote data servers such as
OPeNDAP or ADDE and even web servers. You can read further about
specific <a href="DataSources.html">sources of data</a> available.

<p>
The general idea is to select the sources of data that you want to work
with within the IDV using the <b>Data Chooser</b>.
Once selected, the data source will be shown in the
<a href="FieldSelector.html">Field Selector</a> window where you can
choose parameters, times and the displays to create.

<p>
The IDV can work with  any number of data sources at one time.
Choosing a data source with the IDV typically just reads the 
metadata (i.e., data about the data),   no parameter data values are 
read until you  request a display to be made. 

<p>
To select the data that is to be used in the IDV
you use the <b>Data Chooser</b> window, which 
is brought up by:


<ul>
<li> Selecting the [ug::button Data Chooser] tab in the Dashboard.
<li> The [ug::menu Data {New Data Source}] menu item in the main menu bar.
</ul>

<div class="pagesubtitle">Using the Map Selector</div>

Some of the choosers (e.g., Level III radar, profiler, RAOB) use a map
of stations. You can zoom and see more stations with a rubber-band box
made by dragging the left mouse button on the map. Also note the icons
below the map to zoom and pan. Reading from left to right, the plus
icon zooms in, the minus icon zooms out, the curving arrow restores the
previous view, and the house icon restores the original view. The up
arrow moves the view up (map down); the down arrows moves the view down
(map up), the left arrow moves the view left (map right) and the right
arrow moves the view right (map left).

<p>
The <b>Declutter</b> check box allows you to show all stations (not
checked), or only a
limited number of stations that do not overlap each other (checked).
You may need to zoom in to see all the stations clearly separated.
TIP: It can be helpful to zoom into an area where
you want to select stations, before clicking on the station, to avoid
the chance of getting a neighbor station by mistake.

<p>

The station map may support selecting either one station (e.g. for radar
data) or multiple stations (e.g., for profiler data). Left clicking on
a station will select it. If in multiple selection mode Shift-drag will
select all stations within a region. Control-drag will add the stations
in the selected region to the set of already selected stations. Pressing
the Control-A key will select all stations. Right clicking in the map
will bring up a menu that allows you to select all stations and to clear
the selection.
