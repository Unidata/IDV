mailapi.jar and smtp.jar:
from: https://java.sun.com/products/javamail/ 
These are from the Java Mail package and are used by RAMADDA
Note: They were originally signed jars. To make them into the 
jar of jars they need to be unjarred and the META_INF directory
removed.


---------------------------------------------------------------
jetty.jar jetty-util.jar:
These are from the Jetty project: https://www.mortbay.org/jetty/
and provide a embeddable web server used by RAMADDA

---------------------------------------------------------------
render.jar:
This holds the pdf/svg/ps rendering code from the FOP project.
render.jar a big jar of the classes in the FOP release.
We get the FOP-0_95 release from:
https://xmlgraphics.apache.org/fop/download.html

From the fop directory we want to unjar all of the jars in lib
and the build/fop.jar

From the FOP  directory copy build/fop.jar to the lib directory
cd to lib and mkdir tmp
ls *.jar> jars
Edit the jars file to do:
jar -xvf ../<the jar file>
for each line (we do this because jar -xvf *.jar does not work)
cd tmp
source ../jars (this unjars all of the jars
now create render.jar
jar -cvf ../../../render.jar *

Now go and build 
ant externaljar
from the ucar main package.
