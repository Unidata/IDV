This section describes how to make plots from 
the NOAA National Profiler Network.
The set of steps involve:

<subhead id="connecting" intoc="false">Connect to NOAA National Profiler Network data</subhead>


In the <a href="../data/choosers/ProfilerChooser.html">Data Chooser</a> select the
<b>Profiler</b> tab.   

[ht::cimg ../data/choosers/images/ProfilerChooser.gif]


In the <b>Server:</b> selection box, use the pull down list to select
a remote ADDE server with Profiler data, such as <b>adde.ucar.edu</b>.
In the [ht::command Data interval] selection box you can choose from 
Hourly, 30 minute, 12 minute, or 6 minute. The Profiler data has
a 6 minute interval; this selection lets you determine what time step
will be used in your IDV displays.
Click on [ht::command Connect].
Some times first appear selected - highlighted. Check individual times on
or off with control-click. Select end times and times of a range
with shift-click.


<p>

Select a station by clicking on it on the map. Select a group of stations by 
dragging the mouse cursor with the shift key to make a 
rubber band box, or do shift-click to select more than one station.
The map shows Profiler station names.

<p>

To see more stations check the [ht::command Declutter] box off, 
The [ht::command Declutter] check box allows you to show all stations (not
checked), or only a limited number of stations that 
do not overlap each other (checked).
More stations appear as you zoom in. 
You may need to zoom in to see all the stations clearly separated.
The icons below the map allow you to zoom and pan.

<p>

Once you have selected one or more stations and a set of times,
click the [ht::command Add Source] button at bottom. You have selected 
this data to be accessible by the IDV. (You have not yet downloaded any
profiler data to the IDV. Loading data occurs only when a display is made.)


<subhead id="display" intoc="false">
Making the Profiler displays</subhead>

A label like &quot;Profiler Hourly - 3 stations&quot;
appears in the <b>Data sources</b> panel in 
<a href="../data/FieldSelector.html">Field Selector window</a>.

[ht::cimg images/ProfilerDSMenu.gif]

The "Profiler winds" item in the
<b>Fields</b> panel allows you to make any of the Profiler displays
for all the stations selected.  You can use the individual station 
fields to make a display only for that station.

<p>

Click on "Time-Height Display" in the <b>Displays</b> panel, to choose
this type of display. Then make the display by clicking on <b>Create
Display</b> in the bottom of the Field Selector window.

<p>

The time/height plot of Profiler data at this station or stations is
made. The colored globe in the lower right corner of the main IDV window
indicates that processing and making displays is in progress.

<p>

Similarly you can choose the Station Plot Profiler display (a mapped
plan view of profiler winds at any single level above sea level) , or
the 3D View of Profiler data which shows winds at all levels and at all
stations selected.
