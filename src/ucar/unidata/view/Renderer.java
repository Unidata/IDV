     *  If the Renderer wants to draw in constant-pixel coordinates, so that its objects do not change as
     *   the user zooms in and out, use the pixelAT transform, which transforms "Normalized Device"
     *   coordinates (screen pixels) to Device coordinates.
     *  The Graphics2D object also has its clipping rectangle set (in World coordinates), which the Renderer may
     *    use for optimization.
     *  The Graphics2D object has default color and line width set; the Renderer should restore any changes it makes.

     * @param pixelAT   transforms "Normalized Device" to Device coordinates.  When drawing to the screen,

     *   Renderers should use "Normalized Device" coordinates if they want to render non-scalable objects.
