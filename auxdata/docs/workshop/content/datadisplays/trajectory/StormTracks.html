<ol class="step">

    <li> [ht::clearDisplaysAndData]

    <li> Load in the ATCF data and create the Storm Track display.
    <ul>
    <li> Normally selecting [ht::menu Data Special {ATCF Data}] will load in a data source with a predefined
    path to the National Hurricane Center ftp site.
    <li> But, for stability and speed in the workshop we copied over the data for 2008 and 2007 to our ftp site so...
    <li> In the URL chooser type in:<br><i>ftp://ftp.unidata.ucar.edu/pub/idv/data/atcf/</i>
    <li>Under [ht::command Data Sources of Type] select &quot;ATCF Tropical Storm Data&quot; (hint: click in the pull-down box and enter an 'a').
    <li> Load in the data source.
    <li> Create a [ht::display Storm Track] display.
    </ul>

    <li> Choose [ht::menu 2008 {Basin:AL} IKE] and select [ht::button Load Tracks]
    <li> Note the huge number of forecasts. We want to pare this list down.
    <ul>
    <li> Bring up the Properties dialog for the display. ([ht::menu Edit Properties] menu).
    <li> In the &quot;Techs to use&quot; tab select all of the Techs in the &quot;Use&quot; list. Click and press control-a.
    <li> Press [ht::button Remove].
    <li> Select a number of Techs in the &quot;Don't use&quot; list and press [ht::button Add]. Make sure you include  GFDL and HWRF in your selection.
    <li> Apply these selections  by pressing [ht::button OK].
    </ul>
    <li> Turn on the [ht::button Forecasts] checkbox to show the forecast tracks.
    <li> Note, the forecasts  tracks are showing forecast hours which results in a complicated display. Turn this off by selecting a &quot;None&quot; for the  Points Layout model.
    <li> Turn off all but one Forecast and set the [ht::command Animation Mode] to &quot;Off&quot;.
    <li> Let's look at charting the forecasts.
    <ul>
    <li> In the [ht::command Storm Chart] tab select GFDL and HWRF and Observation in the Techs list.
    <li> Select one of the later times, e.g., 2008-09-10.
    <li> Select both [ht::button Min Pressure] and [ht::button Max Windspeed].
    <li> Turn on [ht::button Use Difference].
