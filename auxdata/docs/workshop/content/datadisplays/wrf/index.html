<title>Working with WRF Output</title>

<div class="overview">
WRF output can be analyzed and visualized in a number of ways interactively, including those mentioned in the "Working With Gridded Data" Section. Another method for working with WRF output is through the use of the Jython scripting language. In this section we will focus on ways to use Jython with WRF output. The first approach will be to use Jython in a batch scripting environment; the second will focus on using Jython to setup the IDV environment for interactive data exploration.
