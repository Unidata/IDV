<div class="overview">
<p>
The IDV makes a vertical Cross Section display from Level II radar volume data. The display
is presented  in a conventional 2D plot, and in a 3D display at the correct position in the atmosphere.

</div>
  
The vertical Cross Section display is constructed from the cross section line and radials from several
azimuthal sweeps available in the WSR-88D Level II output files.

<p>

If necessary, select Level II data and times as described in
[ht::popup "LoadingLevelIIData.html" "Accessing WSR-88D Level II Radar Data"].

<p>

<ol class="step">

<li>[ht::clearDisplays]

<li>Make sure the menu item
        [ht::menu Projections {Auto-set Projection}] option is checked on.

<li>In the [ht::dialog Field Selector] window create a [ht::display {Radar Cross Section}]
    display using the [ht::param Reflectivity] field.</li>
<p>

The Cross Section control window appears in the [ht::dialog Dashboard].
The Cross Section display appears inside the Cross Section control window as a 2D plot.

<li>The Cross Section also appears in the main 3D view window.
    View the Cross Section in 3D, and change the Cross Section line position.</li>
  <ul class="substep">
   <li>Rotate, pan, and zoom  the 3D display as needed to see the
    Cross Section in 3D.
    <popup label="More about Cross Section displays">
    Note the Cross Section display is not a replacement of the RHI dislplay, if the number of intersections
    of the Cross Section line and radials of each sweep is low,
    the Cross Section display will have very few pixel points.
    </popups>
    <li>Move the cross section selector so it cuts across the storm center
    You can move the line by clicking and dragging the end selector point on the selector line.
    <li>If desired, restore the initial overhead
    viewpoint with the key combination Ctrl-r.

<li>Working with the 2D Cross Section display</li>
  <ul class="substep">
    <li>Pan the 2D display with a right mouse button drag,
    and zoom the display by dragging the right mouse button forward
    and backward with the Shift key pressed.
    <li>You can change the vertical scale of the 2D cross section view.
    <li>You can change the selector location by entering lat/lon of the end points of the cross section.
  </ul>
