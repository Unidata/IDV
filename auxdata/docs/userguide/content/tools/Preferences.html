You use preferences to save standard settings of the IDV, such as the map
projection to show when the IDV starts.
The Preferences Dialog  is  opened through the
<a href="../ui/Menus.html#edit">Edit menu</a>
with [ug::menu Edit  {Preferences}].

<p>
Note: Some of these preferences only take effect the next time
you run the IDV or when you create a new view window.
The preferences also may be overwritten when you use bundles.
See <a href="../Bundles.html">here</a> for more information about 
the bundle facility.

[ug::prefGroup {General Preferences}]

[ht::cimg images/preferences/General.gif {General Preferences}]

Click on Cancel if you wish to exit preferences setting, Ok to
accept the changed preferences and close this window, and Apply to
accept the preferences and keep this window open.


[ug::prefSubGroup {General}]

[ug::preference {Show Help Tip Dialog On Start} ]
Should the  help tip window be shown at start up.

[ug::preference {Confirm Before Exiting}]
Ask user to confirm before the application exits.

[ug::preference {Show Dashboard On Start}]
Should the dashboard window be shown when the IDV starts.

[ug::preference {Show field selector}]
Should the  separate field selector window be shown at start up.


[ug::prefSubGroup {When Opening a Bundle}]

[ug::preference {Prompt user to remove displays and data}]
Allows you to control if the prompt dialog is shown before a bundle is opened.

[ug::preference {Remove all displays and data sources}]
Allows you to specify
that before a bundle is loaded  should all the existing data and displays be removed.



[ug::prefSubGroup {Display Controls}]

[ug::preference {Show windows when they are created}]
Specifies that when a display is
created its control window is automatically shown.

[ug::preference {Use Fast Rendering}]
Should the displays always use fast rendering. This allows for faster display rendering
at the risk of incorrect displays (e.g., when display lines cross projection seams).

[ug::preference {Auto-select data when loading a template}]
A display can be saved as a template without data. When it is created should the IDV
attempt to automatically select the appropriate data fields.



[ug::prefSubGroup {When Display Control is Closed}]


[ug::preference {Remove the display}]
Specifies that when a display's window
is closed then the display itself is removed.

[ug::preference {Remove standalone displays}]
When the window is closed for a stand alone display (i.e., one that does
not have a display component in a main view window. e.g., html display)
should the display be removed.


[ug::prefSubGroup {Other}]

[ug::preference {Resource Sitepath}]
Allows you to define where the 
IDV looks for additional resources. Use this when you want to
have a set of resources shared by a group of users. See
the <a href="../SiteConfiguration.html"> Site Configuration</a>
documentation for more details.


[ug::preference {Look and  Feel}]
Define the Java look and feel to use. This will take effect when you next run the IDV.





[ug::prefGroup Formats and Data]

[ht::cimg images/preferences/FormatsAndData.gif {Formats and Data Preferences}]

[ug::preference {Date Format}]
This allows you to define how the IDV displays dates. 
The date format string  uses the following symbols. Note, these symbols can
be repeated to give different results. For example:
<pre>
&quot;MMMM&quot; gives full month name
&quot;MMM&quot; gives short month name
&quot;MM&quot; gives  2 digit month number
&quot;M&quot; gives  1 or 2 digit month number
</pre>

<table>

</table>




[ug::preference {Time Zone}]
Choose the time zone to display time with.



[ug::preference {Lat/Lon Format} {latlonformat}]
Format used when showing lat/lon. This is a normal decimal format that can 
contain the symbols:
<table>
 <tr><td>0<tr><td>Digit</td></tr>  
 <tr><td>#</td><td>Digit, zero shows as absent</td></tr>  
 <tr><td>.</td><td>Decimal separator or monetary decimal separator</td></tr>  
 <tr><td>-</td><td>Minus sign</td></tr>  
 <tr><td>,</td><td>Grouping separator</td></tr>  
 <tr><td>E</td><td>Separates mantissa and exponent in scientific notation.</td></tr>  
 <tr><td>;</td><td>Subpattern boundary Separates positive and negative subpatterns</td></tr>    
</table>




[ug::preference {Probe format}]
This defines an html template that is used to display data readouts in
the data probe display. This html template can contain macros that are replaced
with the probed values.
Macros are:
<br>%value% Formatted value
<br>%unit% Display unit
<br>%rawvalue% Unformatted value
<br>%rawunit% Original unit



[ug::preference {Distance Unit}] 
When displaying distances (e.g., in the Range and Bearing Control) this is the default unit that is used.



[ug::preference {Sampling Mode}]
You can specify  the type of sampling you want for the various data probes.  Choose between a weighted average sampling or nearest neighbor.

[ug::preference {Pressure to Height}]
You can specify  the type of algorithm you want to use for converting from pressure coordinates to height.  See the <a href="../Faq.html#pressure_to_height">FAQ</a> for more information on this option.



[ug::preference  {Cache Data in Memory}]
The IDV normally tries to cache data that it loads in memory. You can turn this behavior off with a preference.

[ug::preference  {Disk Cache Size}]
The IDV will cache some data sets to disk to eliminate network latency.  Specify the maximum amount of disk size with this preference.


[ug::preference {Max Image Size}]
This field allows you to set a maximum image size (in pixels) that is to be displayed.
When this preference is set the image display will adjust the Pixel Sampling to
reduce the image to less than the preferred value. This allows for the initial
display of large images without causing  memory issues.


[ug::preference {Grid Threshold}]
This field allows you to set a size limit for holding grids in memory.
Grids larger than this size will be cached to disk instead of held
in memory during the IDV session.  This allows loading large grids and
long loops of grids without a major performance hit.


[ug::prefGroup View]

[ht::cimg images/preferences/MainDisplay.gif {View Preferences}]


The <b>View</b> tab allows you to set preferences related to the
main 3D map view window.


[ug::prefSubGroup Legends]
[ug::preference {Show Side Legend}]
Do you  prefer the side display  legend.

[ug::preference {Show Bottom Legend}]
Do you  prefer the bottom display  legend.

[ug::preference {Show Animation Boxes}]
Do you  prefer seeing the animation boxes in the time animation control.

[ug::preference {Show Overview Map}]
A 3D display can have a small overview map shown under the legend.
Note: This is kind of flaky.


[ug::prefSubGroup Display]

[ug::preference {Show Wireframe Box}]
Toggles the  visibility of a 3D wireframe box around the data. This box 
helps provide orientation in 3D views.


[ug::preference {Show Cursor Readout}]
Display a label of latitude,
longitude, and altitude of the cursor position over the display, shown
in the lower border of the view window.


[ug::preference {Clip View At Box}]
Allows you to elide from view 
all display elements outside the wireframe box. This is helpful to 
remove map lines outside the area of data.


[ug::preference {Show Display List}]
Should a listing of the titles and times of the display controls be shown in the
main view window.


[ug::preference {Show Times In Display}]
Turn on the label, shown inside the main display, 
that shows the current animation time.

[ug::preference {Show Map Display Scales}]
Show a vertical scale in the map displays.


[ug::preference {Show TransectDisplay Scales}]
Show a vertical scale in the transect displays.

[ug::preference {Show &quot;Please Wait&quot; Message}]
Display the &quot;Please Wait&quot; message in the display.


[ug::preference {Reset Projection With New Data}]
When checked will cause each new
display made in the IDV to snap the whole view window to the native projection of the
data. This can be undesirable if you are overlaying several kinds of
some of which have differing projections.



[ug::preference {Use 3D View}]
Allows you to override the default 3D behavior of the IDV and use
a 2D View for Map Views.


</div>


[ug::prefSubGroup Toolbars]
[ug::preference {Show Earth Navigation Panel}]
Show a graphical navigation panel. 


[ug::preference {Show Viewpoint Toolbar}] 
Enable the <a href="../ui/Navigation.html#viewpoint">Viewpoint toolbar</a>.

[ug::preference {Show Zoom/Pan Toolbar}] 
Enable the <a href="../ui/Navigation.html#navigation">Zoom/Pan toolbar</a>.


[ug::prefSubGroup {Color Scheme}]
You can specify the 
default foreground/background colors. The foreground  color is applied to
the bounding box lines and the time readout. The color of the  maps
is controlled by the individual 
<a href="../controls/MapDisplayControl.html">map control</a>.




[ug::prefGroup Navigation]

You can change how the IDV interprets mouse and keyboard events for navigating in 
3D space. 
For each combination of mouse button and control/shift keys  you can select an action.


[ht::cimg images/preferences/Mouse.gif {Mouse Event Preferences}]



There are a number of navigation functions (e.g., rotate) that can be triggered
by a key press. The Keyboard preference tab allows you to define the key and
any modifier (i.e., control, shift):

[ht::cimg images/preferences/Keyboard.gif {Keyboard Event Preferences}]



[ug::prefGroup {Toolbar}]

[ht::cimg images/preferences/Toolbar.gif {Toolbar Preferences}]
Allows you to define what action/icons are displayed in the toolbar. The list on the
left shows all of the available actions. The list on the right
shows the actions which make up the toolbar. You can add/remove actions
to/from the toolbar list. The [ug::button Add space] button adds a space
between toolbar entries. The [ug::button Reload Original] resets the toolbar
list to the one before any changes have been made.
The [ug::button Reload System] button resets  the toolbar list to
the original one defined in the system.



[ug::prefGroup Available Choosers]

[ht::cimg images/preferences/Choosers.gif {Chooser Preferences}]


The <b>Available Choosers</b> tab  allows you to define what types of data 
choosers to use. This is a way to simplify the data chooser window,
only showing those tabs that you want to use.
You can either select
to  &quot;Use all choosers&quot; or
&quot;Use selected choosers&quot;
and select individual choosers to use.

[ug::prefGroup Available Displays]

[ht::cimg images/preferences/Displays.gif {Display Preferences}]


The <b>Available Displays</b> tab allows you to specify  what types of displays to 
fuse. You can either select to 
&quot;Use all displays&quot; 
or
&quot;Use selected displays&quot;.
The list of displays is hierarchical. You can turn on or off
the user of all displays, specific groupings or individual
displays.
