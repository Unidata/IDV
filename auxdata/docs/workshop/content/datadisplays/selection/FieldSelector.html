<title>Using the Field Selector</title>
</head>

<body>

<div class="overview">
The Field Selector is used to select data sources, parameters,
data times, and types of displays to use for creating visualizations.
</div>

<h3>Field Selector</h3>

<p>The [ht::tab Field Selector] consists of 4
panels:

<ul class="step">

  <li>[ht::command Data Sources] - used for selecting
      data sources that are currently loaded into the IDV. 
      [ht::dataset Formulas] is a particular
      data source for applying formulas to other data sources.</li>

  <li>[ht::command Fields] - displays the list of
      data choices (parameters, formulas) for the selected data source.</li>

  <li>[ht::command Displays] - holds the list of
      display types applicable to the selected field.</li>

  <li>[ht::command Data Subset] - depending on the type of data,
      this panel displays the list of times, levels and spatial subsetting
      associated with the selected data choice.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Data Sources</h3>

When the IDV reads in a data source, most of the time it only reads
enough metadata to be able to create a list of [ht::param data choices]. 
Some of the datasets may be quite large and this allows
you to only read those portions that you need instead of the entire
dataset.

<ol class="step">
  <li>Right click the [ht::dataset NCEP Model Data ETA]
      data source in the [ht::command Data Sources]
      panel of the [ht::tab Field Selector]
      window and select the [ht::menu {Properties}] menu.</li>
  <li>Each [ht::dialog {Data Source Properties Dialog}] will 
      have one or more tabs for setting and viewing the properties
      of that data source.  Tab through the properties of this
      data source.</li>
  <li>Click the [ht::button Cancel] button to close the window</li>
</ol>

<h3>Data Choices (Fields)</h3>

When a data source is loaded, a set of [ht::param data choices] 
are created from the metadata. This allows you to select
a subset of the dataset.

<ol class="step">

  <li>Select the [ht::dataset NCEP Model Data ETA]
      data source in the [ht::command Data Sources]
      panel of the [ht::tab Field Selector]
      window.</li>

  <li>In the [ht::command Fields] panel, you will
      see two tabs - [ht::param 3D grid] and 
      [ht::param 2D grid] indicating that this dataset has
      both 2D and 3D fields in it.</li>

  <li>Click on the little tab to the left of the 
      [ht::param 3D grid] field to expand that tab.
      The list contains those 3D fields from the dataset
      that the IDV can display.</li>

  <li>Select the [ht::param temperature] field.  When
      you select a field, the [ht::command Displays]
      and [ht::command Data Subset] panels are populated with
      entries applicable to that field.

</ol>

<p><b>Derived Choices</b><p>

When a data source creates the list of data choices from the parameters
in a dataset, it also uses a library of pre-defined derived quantities
to create a list of choices for fields that can be calculated from the
fields in the dataset.

<ul class="step">

  <li>Expand the [ht::param Derived] tab.</li>

  <li>In the expanded list, select [ht::param {Dewpoint (from T &amp; RH)}]. 
      This dataset does not have
      a dewpoint field in it, but it does have temperature (T) and
      relative humidity (RH) which can be used to calculate dewpoint.
  </li>

</ul>

<h3>Displays</h3>

When each data choice is created, the metadata for that choice
is used to determine which displays are applicable to that field.

<ol class="step">

   <li>Look at the list of available display types for your
       Dewpoint selection in the [ht::command Displays]
       panel.</li>

   <li>Select the [ht::param {Flow Vectors (from GridRelative_u &amp; GridRelative_v)}]
       field and notice that the list of displays changes.</li>

   <li>Select the [ht::param {Sounding Data (T &amp; dewpoint only)}]
       field and notice that you get another list of displays.</li>

   <li>Select [ht::param {Dewpoint (from T &amp; RH)}]
       again.</li>

   <li>In the [ht::command Displays] panel, select
       [ht::display {Contour Plan View}] so we can
       create a horizontal slice of the data and display it as
       contours.</li>

</ol>

<h3>Data Subsetting</h3>

The [ht::command Data Subset] panel allows you to temporally and
spatially subset the data you've chosen.   For this exercise, we
will look at subsetting by time and level.

<p><b>Times</b><p>

Each data choice may or may not have times associated with it
which are displayed in the [ht::command Times]
panel. If there is a set of times, you can select one of the four
menu items in the drop down menu: [ht::menu {Use Default}], [ht::menu {Use Selected}],
    [ht::menu {Match Time Driver}], and [ht::menu {Set As Time Driver}].

<ul class="step">

  <li>You can set the time subset for all parameters in the dataset.

    <ol class="substep">
      <li>Double click (or right click and select the 
          [ht::menu Properties] menu) on the dataset name in the
          [ht::command Data Sources] panel to bring up the 
          [ht::dialog Data Source Properties] editor.</li>

      <li>This dataset has ten time steps. In the 
          [ht::tab Times] tab,
          select the [ht::menu {Use Selected}] menu item
          in the drop down menu.  You can now select the subset of times.  Select
          the first five (5) times in the list
          ([ht::param 1998-06-29 12:00:00Z]
           to [ht::param 1998-06-30 12:00:00Z]). 
          [ht::listSelect]</li>

      <li>Click the [ht::button OK] button to apply
          this change and close the window.

      <li>Notice that the change is reflected in the 
          [ht::tab Times] tab of the [ht::command Data Subset] panel
          when you select [ht::param Dewpoint] this time.</li>

    </ol>
  </li>

  <li>You can set the time subset for a single parameter 
      in the [ht::tab Times] tab.

    <ol class="substep">

      <li>In the [ht::tab Times] tab of the [ht::command Data Subset]
          panel, select [ht::menu {Use Selected}] menu item.
      <li>In the list of times in that panel, 
          select the last four (4) times in the list
          ([ht::param 1998-06-30 18:00:00Z] 
          to [ht::param 1998-07-01 12:00:00Z]).</li>
    </ol>
     
  </li>
  <li>You can set the time subset to match display driver times
      <ol class="substep">
          <li>If a user selects the [ht::menu {Match Time Driver}] menu item, the IDV will check
          the current active view window to make sure there is a time driver available.
          Otherwise, an error message will appear to remind the user a driver is needed first.
          When the IDV confirms that a time driver is available, the time list of this
          dataset will be removed in the subset panel, and the times used by the time
          driver in the current active display will be used. </li>
      </ol>
  </li>
  <li>You can set the time subset to be the display time driver
      <ol class="substep">
          <li>If a user selects the [ht::menu {Set As Time Driver}] menu item, the selected times of this
          dataset will be used as the driver times for this view window. Only one time
          driver is allowed in each view window, and the most recent display set as the
          time driver will be used.  </li>
      </ol>
  </li>

</ul>

<p><b>Levels</b><p>

Each data choice may or may not have levels associated with it
which are displayed in the [ht::tab Level] tab of the
[ht::command Data Subset] panel.  If you do not select a
level, the first level is read in unless you are creating
a display that needs a volume of data.

<ul class="step">

  <li>You can set the level subset for a single parameter 
      in the [ht::tab Level] panel.

    <ol class="substep">

      <li>In the [ht::tab Level] tab, select the 
          [ht::param {850 hectopascal}] level.
    </ol>
     
  </li>

</ul>

When you are finished making all your selections, click the
<code class="button">Create Display</code> button to apply them
and create the display.  The subset of data you selected will
be read from the data source and displayed in the currently active
<code class="dialog">View Window</code>.
