To set the defaults for a data source bring up the 
Properties dialog by right clicking  (or double clicking)
on the data source name in the data sources panel
of the Field Selector window and select [ug::menu Properties]:

The Properties Dialog is different for different types of data sources. Here is 
the dialog window for a gridded data source:

Any displays that are showing data from a data source can be automatically
updated by selecting the [ug::button Reload Displays] button. When this is selected
all data will be reloaded and the displays will be updated when the user presses
[ug::button Apply] or [ug::button OK].

<subhead intoc="false" id="basicproperties">Basic Properties</subhead>
You can change the displayed name with the [ug::button Name] field.

<p>
Some data sources can automatically update themselves by selecting
the [ug::button Active] button. For example, if you had a set of most recent 
satellite images you can turn on Polling and have the data update to the latest
images every N minutes.
<p>
For point data you can define  <i>Time Binning</i> settings (not shown) by selecting
a Bin Size (e.g., 5 minutes, 1 hour) and a Round To value (e.g., On the hour, 15 minutes after the
hour). This will map all the observation times into the nearest bin.  The smallest time is rounded
with the Round To value (e.g., if Round To was &quot;10 after&quot; and the smallest time was
10:23 then this time would be rounded to 10:20). This is the base time. Each actual observation time
is mapped into a set of bins of Bin Size starting at the base time.


<subhead intoc="false" id="times">Times</subhead>
The Times tab allows you to select the times to use. Click off the [ug::button Use All]
button and select individual times. You can right mouse click in the list
to show a popup menu that allows you to select different strides (e.g., every 3rd time).

<subhead intoc="false" id="spatialsubset">Spatial Subsetting</subhead>
For grids and other data source types  the data can be subset and decimated
with the [ug::button {Spatial Subset}] tab.
The [ug::menu {X Stride}], [ug::menu {Y Stride}] and [ug::menu {Z Stride}] menus
allow you to decimate a grid, selecting every Nth point.
The [ug::button Bounding Box] allows you to define a spatial area to load.
The default spatial domain of the data is shown by the blue outline box.
To select an area just drag on the map. Once a subset is selected it can be
resized (grab on the little black selection points) moved  (grab somewhere near the 
box) and delete (press the Delete key).
Specific lat/lon values can be entered in the fields on the left.

[ht::cimg images/DataSourceSpatialSubset.gif]

A version of this spatial subsetting window is used in the Field
Selector. Here, you explicitly enable these settings. The decimation
and spatial subset are shown in different tabs:

<subhead intoc="false" id="details">Details</subhead>
The Details tab shows further information about the data source, e.g.:
any documentation associated with the data, what files or urls are used, etc.


<subhead intoc="false" id="metadata">Metadata</subhead>
For grid data sources the Metadata tab shows the NetCDF metadata.
