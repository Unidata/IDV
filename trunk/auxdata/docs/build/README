The generate.tcl script is used to preprocess a collection of html
files and generate a set of integrated, navigable pages.
It can create  index, glossarys, faqs,  html popups, etc.

The script is driven by index files called main.index. These
files define the html files you want processed and their 
hierarchical organization. A page can be a "parent" of other pages.
These parent pages can have their list of children embedded within them.

The  style and structure of a processed page is driven by html templates.
By default the script will look for a template called Template.html
(more later).


------------------------------
Html and directory structure
------------------------------

To see how this all works lets look at an example
For example, assume you have a docs directory:

docs
  |
  +----- lib.tcl (optional tcl lib that is sourced)
  |
  +----- main.index 
  |
  +----- index.html
  |
  +----- image.gif
  |
  +-----subdir1
          |
          +--------main.index
          |
          +--------index.html
          |
          +--------content1.html
          |
          +--------content2.html
          |
          +--------images
                     |
                     +---- image2.gif



The docs/main.index file would contains:
index.html
>subdir1

The docs/subdir1/main.index file contains:

index.html
>content1.html
>content2.html


When you run the script from the docs directory:

    tclsh /upc/share/metapps/html/generate.tcl -verbose

(Note: do a:
tclsh /upc/share/metapps/html/generate.tcl -help
to get a listing of the command line arguments)

the script will process each page, generating table of contents, etc. 
By default it will create a mirror directory tree called processed, 
as a peer of the docs tree. To override this use:

    tclsh /upc/share/metapps/html/generate.tcl -verbose -target /some/other/directory

All gif and jpg files in the directories the script looks at will be copied.
Also, all images subdirs and their subdirs wil be recursively copied.
The script will also copy over any style sheets (*.css) that are in your docs directory
and automatically insert the links to the style sheets in the generated html.



------------------------------
  Index files
------------------------------

Each line in an index file can begin with a greater than sign (">").
to  define the hierarchical organization. For example,  you can have
in a index file:

Top.html
>Sub1.html
>>Sub1_1.html
>>Sub1_2.html
>Sub2.html


Each line can also be a set of comma separated files:
Top.html
>Sub1.html,Sub2.html,...

Each file can also be a glob style regular expression:
Top.html
>Sub*.html


It can also be another index file:
Top.html
>another.index


Or an index file in a subdirectory:
Top.html
>subdir/main.index


If a line in an index file is a directory then we append the index file name to it
and recurse, e.g.:
Top.html
>subdir

is equivalent to:

Top.html
>subdir/main.index




You can comment out a line in an index file with "#". e.g.:

content1.html
content2.html
#content3.html
...



You can define "virtual" pages with the "title:" prefix. e.g.:

title:Page name:Optional page text
>sub1.html
>sub2.html

will generate a page called title_page_name.html that contains the
page text and is the parent of sub1.html and sub2.html



You can define linked pages with the "link:" prefix. e.g.:
SomePage.html
>link:SomePage.html#some_a_name:Title to use
>link:SomePage.html#some_other_a_name:Another title to use

This  results  in SomePage.html being processed normally. There are entries
placed in the generated table of contents for the two  subpages.



You can specify that a file is copied, but not pre-processed, in the index file
by prepending a "-":

content1.html
-filetobecopied.html
...





------------------------------
Titles and page descriptions
------------------------------

Each index.html and content.html html files should have, at a minimum, a title
tag. They  can also contain  a description. The description can be specified in 
a variety of forms:

   Using meta tags:
     <title>Some title</title> 
     <meta name="description" content="Some description">

   Using a div with class=overview
     <title>Some title</title> 
     <div class="overview">Some description</div>



The description is used when the list of children in a parent page
is generated. This is on by default but can be controlled with the
-childoverview/-nochildoverview
command line arguments or with the call:
gen::setIncludeChildOverview 0



------------------------------
Running
------------------------------

To run the script  you need to be in the top level directory of
your docs tree. Simply run:
tclsh /upc/share/metapps/html/generate.tcl

By default this will create a directory next to docs called generated.
You can override this through command line arguments. Do a:



------------------------------
New tags
------------------------------

Popup tag:
The script supports generating popup web pages. 
<popup label="The link label">The content of the popup page</popup>

This will result in a link  "The link label" that pops up a generated page that holds
"The content of the popup page"



Note tag:
<note>some text that is not included in the generated html when running generate.tcl -finalversion (which
is the default).</note>
To include note text call
generate.tcl -nofinalversion


Faqs:
You can automatically generate faqs:
<faq>
   <faqitem q="Some question">The answer</faqitem>
   <faqitem q="Another question">Another  answer</faqitem>
</faq>


These can also be categorized:
<faq>
   <faqitem cat="Some category"</faqitem>
   <faqitem q="Some question">The answer</faqitem>
   <faqitem q="Another question">Another  answer</faqitem>

   <faqitem cat="Some other category"</faqitem>
   <faqitem q="More question">More  answer</faqitem>
</faq>



Subhead tag:
You can define sub header sections using the subhead tag:
<subhead id="some_id">Title of subhead</subhead>

This generates:
<a nmae="some_id"></a>
<div class="pagesubtitle"> PAGE_LEVEL_LABEL Title  of subhead</div>

This will also add the subhead as  a "linked" child of the page.
This will include the subhead  in the table of contents. You can turn  this
off with:
<subhead id="some_id" intoc="false">Title of subhead</subhead>


Glossary tag:
You can define a glossary in a variety of formats.
In you html you can use a glossary tag:

<glossary definition="some definiton">some word</glossary>
Will add "some word" into your glossary and make a link to it.

<glossary word="some word" definition="some definiton">some variant form of some word</glossary>
Will add "some word" into your glossary and make a link to it.

Without the definition you can just have a link into the glossary:
<glossary>some word</glossary>
<glossary word="some word">some variant form of some word</glossary>

You can also have a glossary.tcl file in your docs directory that allows you to predefine the
definitions. eg.:
more glossary.tcl

glossary {UPC} {Unidata Program Center}
glossary {IDV} {The Integrated Data Viewer}
glossary {Isosurface} {A type of display that shows a 3D surface for a given value}
glossary {Plan view} {A type of display that shows a horizontal surface.}


Definining an index:
An index is simple to do. Just use an anchor tag with class="index":
<a name="..." class="index">some text</a>







------------------------------
Page Templates
------------------------------
The actual html is generated using a set of page templates. There are 2 default ones:
/upc/share/metapps/html/Template.html
/upc/share/metapps/html/GeneralTemplate.html

The Template.html is used for  content pages.
The GeneralTemplate.html is used for table of contents, main index, glossary, etc.

To change the look simply copy these templates into your docs directory (or into
a docs/templates directory). The templates hold macros, e.g., %title%, that are replaced
with the appropriate html text.


------------------------------
Embedding tcl in your documents 
------------------------------
You can embed tcl code in your html to aid in formatting, etc. This is useful if you 
find yourself doing the same thing over and over again. Enable this with the -tcleval 
command line  argument:
tclsh generate.tcl -tcleval

In your html just bracket the tcl calls with "[" & "]":

here is some html [ht::test somestring] and some more html

This treats ht::test as a tcl procedure, passing in the string "somestring"

Now ht::test can be defined in a lib.tcl file in your top level docs directory:

lib.tcl:
 
proc ht::test {s} {
        return "Some html adornments $s and some more adornments"
}


Look in generate.tcl for some predefined examples.

Note: If you enable tcl evaluation any use of a square bracket is considered tcl code.
To turn this off you need to escape the square  bracket:

Here is some html, and oh look I am using a \[ bracket.


If you want this to always be enabled you can call the enable function in your lib.tcl:

#Turn on tcl evaluation
gen::setDoTclEvaluation 1
