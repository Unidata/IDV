{Drawing Control}

{
<meta name="jhid" value="idv.controls.drawingcontrol">

The drawing control is a drawing editor that supports
polygons, lines, shapes and text. It behaves like other two-dimensional
drawing editors - you can choose the tool to use (e.g., move, create graphic,
etc.), apply the tool in the main 3D window, select graphic objects, etc.
<p>
<b>A caveat:</b> drawing and selecting in 3D is at times tricky. Sometimes
it is best to be in the main overhead view.


<p>
The user interface consists of 3 tabs. The first allows for the user to set
the drawing mode:
[ht::cimg images/DrawingControlGui1.gif]

The second sets the drawing style:
[ht::cimg images/DrawingControlGui2.gif]

And the third lists all of the graphical elements:
[ht::cimg images/DrawingControlGui3.gif]
Double clicking on an element will show its properties editor through which you can
change its color, line width, position, etc.

[ht::cimg images/DrawingControlProperties.gif {Shape Properties}]


Note: The drawing control will only respond to events (e.g., mouse drag to draw) when its window
is being show. For example, if it is not visible in the dashboard tab then no drawing
will take place.
<p>
The distance and area of a shape will be shown when it is being drawn, in the Shapes list
and in the shape properties. You can change the distance unit through the 
[ug::menu  Edit {Change Display Unit...}] menu.

{
{Mode} 

{
There are three editing modes, select, move and reshape: 
<ul>
<li> <img src="images/pointer.gif"> Allows you to select one or more drawing objects. 
To select multiples press the control key. The selected objects will be shown with
small blue rectangles. Once selected you can bring up the object's property editor
by pressing Control-P. You can also delete the selected objects by pressing Control-X.
You can select all of the objects by pressing Control-A.
<p>
<b>A caveat:</b> Some objects can only be selected by clicking on or near certain points.
Rectangles and diamonds click near the upper left or lower right. For text click near the beginning
of the text string for left justified text, near the center for center justified text or near the
end for right justified text.

<li> <img src="images/Move16.gif"> Allows you to move an object.

<li> <img src="images/Reshape16.gif"> Allows you to move one of the points that define the location of an object.
</ul>
}
}

{
{Enabled} 
{
This checkbox allows you to disable/enable drawing. For example, if you wanted to manipulate
other elements in the display (e.g., probe point, cross section, other drawing controls),
you can disable the drawing control so that it does not respond to any mouse events in the
main display.
}
}

{
{Shapes} 
{
The shape buttons allow you to create:
<ul>
<li> <img src="images/SmoothPoly16.gif">  Click and drag in the main display to create a smooth polygon.
<li> <img src="images/Poly16.gif">  Click and drag in the main display to create a straight line polygon.
Press the space bar to add joint points.
<li> <img src="images/Line16.gif">, <img src="images/Rectangle16.gif">, <img src="images/Diamond16.gif">  Click and drag in the main display to create the shape.
<li> <img src="images/Text16.gif"> Click in the main display and type to enter text. When done entering text hit

<li> <img src="images/WayPoint16.gif"> Click in the main display to create a waypoint - text and a shape.


<li> <img src="images/Image16.gif"> Click in the main display to create an image. 
Select an image file from the  file chooser.
Note: drawing with the image is a bit flaky. The [ug::button Full Lat/Lon] button controls
how the corners of the image are positioned.

<li> Fronts - The drawing control also supports draing a number of front and high/low symbols.
The icon buttons allow you to draw 5 different front types. However, there are 20+ front types
to choose from in the Properties dialog for the shape.

</ul>
}
}

{
{Location} 
{
The drawing control allows you to draw in four different coordinate systems:
<ul>
<li> Lat/Lon/Alt - The points of the shapes are defined by Latitude/Longitude/Altitude. When you reproject
the display the shape will also be reprojected.
<li> Lat/Lon - Like Lat/Lon/Alt but the z position is fixed using the Z Position slider.
<li> X/Y/Z - Draw in the 3D box coordinate space. Re-projections will no effect the shape.
<li> X/Y - Like X/Y/Z but the z position is fixed.
</ul>

For now the [ug::button Full Lat/Lon] is not fully implemented.
}
}

{{Z Position} 
{Allows you to define what is the fixed Z position.}
}


{
{Time} 
{
If you have the [ug::button Draw in current time] checkbox turned on then  the graphic shapes that
that you are drawing will only be shown in the current animation time
in the 3D view. This facility allows you to, for example,  annotate features
through time by drawing on the feature, stepping the time animation, and then
drawing in the next time.
To see all of the objects irrespective of their display times select the [ug::button Show all] checkbox.
<p>
A graphic can be shown in more than one times using  the property editor. Select the object and
press Control-P to bring up the property editor.
Select the times to be displayed in in the [ug::button Times] list (Shift-click or Control-click to
select multiples) and press [ug::button Apply] or [ug::button Ok].
}
}




{{Color, Line Width, etc.} 
{These widgets allow you to define the color, line width, font, and text justification.}
}

{{Edit Menu} 
{There is a &quot;Remove All&quot; entry in the edit menu that removes  all graphic objects from the display.}
}

{{File Menu} {
Under the file menu you can choose  to  export the objects in the drawing control. 
This creates a simple xml file  (a .xgrf file suffix) that defines the objects and 
that can be re-imported.
