The IDV uses the formula mechanism to automatically create 
"derived" quantities based on the fields in a particular
data source.  When the data source is read in, the list
of derived quantities is evaluated  against the list of
variables in the  data.   Users can define their  own
derived quantities by:

<ul>
<li> Defining an IDV formula by name, description, and 
mathematical formula.
<li> Using special operators (D1, D2, ... DN) for the variable
names.
<li> Specifying the binding  between the special operators and
the parameters names or system aliases.
<li>Saving the formula and loading or reloading a data source.
</ul>

See the <a href="Formulas.html">Formulas</a> section for an overview of 
creating IDV formulas.
<P>

Create a formula select the [ug::menu Edit Formulas {Create Formula}] 
menu item. This brings  up the <b>Formula Editor</b> dialog box
used to define a formula:

[ht::cimg images/formula/AddDerived1.gif]

The minimal information you need to provide is the name
of the formula and the actual formula.
<p>

You can use the [ht::command Derived]
tab in the [ht::command Formula Editor] to set the bindings between
formula parameters and fields/aliases.    You need to check
the [ht::command {Create derived quantities}] checkbox  to enable
this as a system formula.
<P>

The parameters to be bound are denoted by operands D1, D2, D3, etc in the
formula itself.  If you need user input, you can use other field
names and the users will be prompted to supply those fields.
<P>

You can define the bindings for the operands using parameter groups or
by specifying the parameters to use. Right clicking in the 
[ht::command Parameter] input field will pop up a menu that 
allows you to select system parameter aliases or parameters from 
fields loaded into the IDV already. 
<P>

Categories specify the types of data that are allowed in this
formula.  For example, if your derived formula is valid only
for 3D Grids, you can select that category from the popup
list.   Access the list by right clicking in the Categories
input fields.
<p>
You can define specific output categories if the type of
the data that the formula creates is different from the
categories that the input operands require.  In general, 
the output categories will be the same as the input categories.
For more information on data categories, see the
<a href="Formulas.html">Formulas</a> section.

<p>
To save the formula, click on <b>Add formula</b>. 
A new entry appears in the Fields panel of the Field Selector.
If you want to apply the formula to an existing data source, you
need to reload that data source.  Right click on the name of the
data source in the [ht::command Data Sources] section of the 
[ht::command Field Selector] and select [ht::menu {Reload Data}].
