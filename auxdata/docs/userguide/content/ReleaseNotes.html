<faqitem cat="Display Changes"></faqitem>

<faqitem q="Smoothing of grids" id="gridsmooth">
Selected grid displays (contours, flow vectors, wind barbs) now have
an option to perform smoothing functions on the grid.  The GEMPAK
5-point (SM5S), 9-point (SM9S) and Gaussian Weighted Function (GWFS)
smoothing functions have been implemented in the IDV.  Users can select
one of these functions in the display <a href="controls/index.html">
control window</a> and/or save these
as a <a href="tools/DisplaySettings.html">Display Setting</a> to use
when creating the display.
</faqitem>

<faqitem q="Capture Time Height Wind Profiler Images" id="prfImg">
A new feature to capture time height wind profiler images has been added, users can now
capture the wind profiler image in the IDV.
</faqitem>

<faqitem q="Point Cloud Display" id="pointcloud">
A new point cloud display was added to the some point data sources to support displaying a large number of points quickly. 
</faqitem>

<faqitem cat="Data Changes"></faqitem>
<faqitem q="New grid diagnostics" id="pvoretc">
New grid diagnostics are available in this release.  The following
have been added:

<ul>
<li>PVOR(S,V) -  Potential Vorticity
<li>QVCL(THTA, V) - Q-Vectors in a layer
<li>SAVG,SAVS  - average over a grid
<li>SM5S, SM9S, SM5V, SM9V, GWFS, GWFV - grid smoothers (5-point, 9-point, Gaussian)
</ul>

You can use the Grid-&gt;Define a grid diagnostic formula to use these
functions.
</faqitem>

<faqitem q="GRIB indexing" id="gribindex">
When GRIB files are read from disk, an index is created to speed up access
to the individual records.  This was always created in the temporary
cache under the DefaultIdv/tmp/nj22 directory.  However, that cache gets 
scoured after a couple of days, the the indexes need to be recreated the
next time you load the data.  There is now an option the 
<a href="tools/Preferences.html">User Preferences</a> under the
Formats &amp; Data tab to control where the indexes are written.  By
unchecking the "Write Grib Index in Disk Cache" option, the indexes will
be written to the same directory as the files and will not be scoured.
</faqitem>
