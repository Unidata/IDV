The Integrated Data Viewer (IDV) from Unidata is a Java&#153;-based
software framework for analyzing and visualizing geoscience
data. This IDV release includes a software library and a
reference application made from that software. It uses the <a
href="https://www.ssec.wisc.edu/~billh/visad.html">VisAD</a>
(http://www.ssec.wisc.edu/~billh/visad.html) and <a
href="https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf-java">netCDF-Java</a>
(https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf-java) libraries and other
Java-based utility packages.

<p>

The IDV is developed at the Unidata Program Center (UPC), part of
the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research (UCAR), Boulder,
Colorado, which is funded by the National Science Foundation. The
software is freely available under the terms of the GNU Lesser General
Public License.

<p>

The IDV "reference application" is a geoscience display and analysis
software system with many of the standard data displays that other
Unidata software (e.g. GEMPAK and McIDAS) provide. It brings together
the ability to display and work with satellite imagery, gridded data
(for example, numerical weather prediction model output), surface
observations, balloon soundings, NWS WSR-88D
Level II and Level III RADAR data, and NOAA National Profiler Network
data, all within a unified interface. It also provides 3-D views of
the earth system and allows users to interactively slice, dice, and
probe the data, creating cross-sections, profiles, animations and
value read-outs of multi-dimensional data sets. The IDV can display
any Earth-located data if it is provided in a known format (see <a
href="data/DataSources.html">Data Sources</a>).

This IDV User's Guide describes using the features available in the 
IDV reference application. The 
<a href="https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/idv/docs/workshop/index.html">Unidata IDV Training Workshop</a> serves as a tutorial.

<p>

The IDV software library can be easily be used and extended to create
custom geoscience applications beyond the atmospheric science realm.  
This customization allows new applications to be tailored
to specific datasets and provide customized user interfaces for different
tasks. Examples of specialized IDV applications include the
<a href="http://geon.unavco.org/unavco/IDV_for_GEON.html">GEON IDV</a> 
(https://geon.unavco.org/unavco/IDV_for_GEON.html) and
<a href="https://www.ssec.wisc.edu/mcidas/software/v/">McIDAS-V</a>
(https://www.ssec.wisc.edu/mcidas/software/v/).

<p>

Development of the IDV is ongoing at the Unidata Program Center.
The development is driven by the needs of the community of users.
Suggestions, comments, and collaboration are welcomed and encouraged.
The goal is to provide new and innovative ways of displaying and
analyzing Earth science data, as well as provide common displays that
many users have come to expect.
