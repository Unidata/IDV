<title>Using VisAD Data in the IDV</title>

<div class="overview">
The IDV uses VisAD [dg::class visad.Data] objects to model the different
types of data.</div><p>

The VisAD data model was designed to support virtually any numerical
data. Rather than providing a variety of specific data structures like
images, grids and tables, the VisAD data model defines a set of classes
that can be used to build any hierarchical numerical data structures.
All these objects are defined in subclasses of [dg::class visad.Data]
and can be compared and manipulated without converting from one form
to another. This page is not meant to be a comprehensive overview
of the VisAD data model, but rather to show what [dg::class Data]
objects are used in the IDV. However, let's look at a good description

<h2>Getting data into the IDV</h2>
The <b>getData()</b> method of the [dg::class DataSource] class
returns a VisAD [dg::class Data] object.   This generalization allows
us to easily create new DataSources without having to cast the return
to a specific form.  The basic task of a developer creating a new
DataSource is to transform the raw data into one of the known VisAD
Data forms that the IDV uses.

<h3>Grids</h3>
The IDV models grids as [dg::class visad.FieldImpl] objects.  A
grid can take the form of:

<PRE>
  (x,y) -> (parm)
  (x,y) -> (parm1, ..., parmN)
  (x,y,z) -> (parm)
  (x,y,z) -> (parm1, ..., parmN)
  (t -> (x,y) -> (parm))
  (t -> (x,y) -> (parm1, ..., parmN))
  (t -> (x,y,z) -> (parm))
  (t -> (x,y,z) -> (parm1, ..., parmN))
  (t -> (index -> (x,y) -> (parm)))
  (t -> (index -> (x,y) -> (parm1, ..., parmN)))
  (t -> (index -> (x,y,z) -> (parm)))
  (t -> (index -> (x,y,z) -> (parm1, ..., parmN)))
</PRE>

In general, t is a time variable, but it might also be just an index.
The [dg::class ucar.unidata.data.grid.GridUtil] class provides a
set of utilities for slicing, dicing and querying data that fits 
into these forms.

<h3>Images (satellite, radar)</h3>
Just like grids, images are modelled as [dg::className FieldImpl-s] 
and generally have the form of:
<PRE>
  (x,y) -> (parm)
  (x,y) -> (parm1, ..., parmN)
  (t -> (x,y) -> (parm))
  (t -> (x,y) -> (parm1, ..., parmN))
</PRE>

<h3>RGB Images (GIF, JPEG, PNG)</h3>
These are also modelled as [dg::className FieldImpl-s], but have 3 
or 4 components:
<PRE>
  (x,y) -> (red, green, blue)
  (x,y) -> (red, green, blue, alpha)
  (t -> (x,y) -> (red, green, blue))
  (t -> (x,y) -> (red, green, blue, alpha))
</PRE>

<h3>Point Data</h3>
Point data (METAR, earthquake, lightning) are modelled using the
[dg::class ucar.unidata.data.point.PointOb] structure which
has the methods:

<pre>
    /**
     * Get the location (lat/lon/alt) of the observation.
     * @return georeference location
     */
    public EarthLocation getEarthLocation();

    /**
     * Get the time of the observation.
     * @return  time the observation was taken
     */
    public DateTime getDateTime();

    /**
     * Get the data associated with this observation.
     * @return observed data for this location and time.
     */
    public Data getData();
</pre>
In the IDV, we use the [dg::class ucar.unidata.data.point.PointObTuple]
to implement this interface as a [dg::class visad.Tuple].

<h3>Text</h3>
Text data is modelled using the [dg::class visad.Text] object which
is basically a wrapper for a String.

<h3>Map Lines</h3>
Map lines are a set of lat/lon and possibly alt points defined by a VisAD
[dg::class visad.Gridded*DSet] where * is usually 2, but can be 
3 if altitude is present.  It has a 1D manifold in either case.

(Latitude, Longitude)
(Latitude, Longitude, Altitude)

<h3>Miscellaeous</h3>
Most other data in the IDV is modelled using some form of 
[dg::className FieldImpl] structure.  For example, aircraft
tracks have the form:

<pre>
  (t -> (x,y,z) -> (parm))
</pre>
but wouldn't be thought of as a grid or image.  However, using
such a structure allows us to easily compare the values along an
aircraft track with colocated points in a grid.

<h3>Geolocation</h3>

Some data (e.g., Point Data) include the necessary information to
geolocate data (Latitude, Longitude, Altitude).  Other data 
(grids, images) may have their spatial extents defined in native
coordinates (line/element, row/column).  The IDV uses the 
[dg::class visad.CoordinateSystem] class to provide the necessary 
transforms for geolocation.  These provide on-the-fly coordinate
transforms.

<h3>Time</h3>
The IDV uses the [dg::class visad.DateTime] class for time animation.
DateTime describes time values in seconds since some point.  It provides
methods for formatting the values to timestamps and creating sets
from arrays of [dg::className DateTime] objects.
