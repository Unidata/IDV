{Gridded Point Data}

{The IDV can create gridded fields of numeric data using
the Barnes Objective Analysis.  You can control the parameters
used to create the grid from the Data Source Properties or
using the &quot;Grid Parameters&quot; tab in the Data Subset panel
of the Field Selector:

[ht::cimg images/GridParameters.gif]

The resulting grid can be displayed using any of the 
Gridded Data Displays.

}


{{Spacing} {
You can set the grid spacing as follows:
<ul>
<li>Automatic - grid spacing will be calculated from the observation density
<li>Degrees - use a specific lat/lon spacing
<li># Points - set the number of grid points in the x and y direction
</ul>
}}

{{Grid Size} {
Specify the grid spacing if not using automatic calculation.
}}

{{Passes} {
Set the number of passes for the Barnes analysis to do
4 passes recommended for analysing fields where derivative
estimates are important (Ref: Barnes 1994b) 3 passes
recommended for all other fields (with gain set to
1.0) (Ref: Barnes 1994c "Two pass Barnes Objective
Analysis schemes now in use probably should be
replaced by appropriately tuned 3pass or 4pass
schemes") 2 passes only recommended for "quick look"
type analyses.
}}


{{Search Radius} {
Set the search radius (in grid units) for the weighting of points in
determining the value at a specific grid point. Should be in the range 
0.2 to 1.0. Data are fitted more closely with a gain of 0.2 
(at the expense of less overall accuracy over the entire grid); larger
values smooth more.
}}


{{Gain} {
Factor by which scaleLength is reduced for the second
pass. Should be in the range 0.2 to 1.0. Data are
fitted more closely with a gain of 0.2 (at the expense
of less overall accuracy over the entire grid); larger
values smooth more. Suggested default: 1.0f
Set the gain for each pass after the first.
