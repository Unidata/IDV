# * Instructions for working with the IDV in the IntelliJ IDE: * #
##################################################################

To open the IntelliJ project, choose “Open Project” and point to IDV/ide/intellij directory (not file, but directory).

Once the project is loaded into the IDE, Open "Project Structure" under "File" and make sure there is an SDK set for the project under "Project Settings -> Project".

In the "Project Structure" settings, make sure j3dutils.jar, vecmath.jar, and j3dcore.jar are in the classpath for your SDK (found under "Platform Settings -> SDKs"). Note that these three files come from the Java-3D package and must be located on your system.

Now that the basic settings are configured, we need to setup IntelliJ to run the IDV. From the toolbar, click "Run" -> "Edit Configurations".  From the "Edit Configurations" widgit, click the '+' sign to add a new "Application" configuration, and use the following settings:

     Main class: ucar.unidata.idv.DefaultIdv
     VM Parameters: -Xmx2048m -XX:MaxPermSize=128m
     Working directory: <path to top of git tree>/
     Uncheck "Make" under "Before Launch"
     Click OK

Now it’s time to build the IDV from source. On the right side of the screen, open the "Ant Build" tab and double-click "idvjar" to build the IDV. After the build completes and the files are re-indexed (which automatically happens after the build), click the green "play" button ( l> ) on the toolbar to start the IDV (make sure DefaultIdv is selected in the Configuration dropdown bock next to the run button). If all goes well, the IDV should start up via the IntelliJ IDE.
