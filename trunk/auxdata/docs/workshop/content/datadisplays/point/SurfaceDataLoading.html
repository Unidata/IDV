METAR and Synoptic data can be accessed in the IDV from
ADDE servers.  The data available is hourly, each hourly file having 
all station observations at that time.

    <li> Select  [ht::command Absolute times] to see a list of data times that you 
    can get from this server.
    <li>The bottom time in the list,  the most recent time, should be highlighted.

    so that two times are selected.
    <li>You could also select [ht::command Use relative times] and select
    [ht::command Most recent 2 times].
    <li>Make sure the [ht::command Layout Model:] is  &quot;Observations&gt;METAR&quot;.
