<div class="pagesubtitle">ISL and XML</div>
Before we start a couple of comments about writing
the ISL. ISL files are written in XML and they need to be 
syntactically correct. A couple of reminders:
<ul>

<li> XML is fully nested. There is only one <i>root</i> tag and all
other tags are descendants of the root.

<li> All tags have to be closed. Either do:
[isl::xml {<sometag/>}] or 
[isl::xml {
<sometag>
    <i>contained tags</i>
</sometag>}]

<li> If you want to include special characters like
'&lt;', '&gt;' and '&quot;' you need to  escape them with:
'&amp;lt;', '&amp;gt;', '&amp;quot;'.

<li> You can comment out sections of XML with '&lt;!--' ... '--&gt;'. e.g:
[isl::xml {
   ...
   <!-- 
      <sometag/>
   -->
}]

</ul>



The ISL file starts with a [isl::tagref isl] tag:
[isl::xml {
<isl debug="true">
...
ISL tags
...
</isl>
}]
If there is a debug=&quot;true&quot; in the [isl::tag isl]
tag then the IDV will print out processing messages.
<p>

Here is a simple isl file:

[isl::importxml capture1.isl]

You can run this by going:<pre>
runIDV capture1.isl
</pre>
or through the [ug::menu File Open] menu from a running IDV.
<p>

Notice when you run this from the  command line that no image is created. 
That is because there
are no view windows. We can load in a bundle before we capture the image.
Note, if you run this isl file you should have a <i>test.xidv</i> bundle file
around.

[isl::importxml capture2.isl]

<i>A caveat:</i> Right now the IDV does not gracefully 
handle when you have a bundle that has more than one 
view window.
<p>

The [isl::tagref pause] tag has the IDV wait until all displays
have been created. The [isl::tagref bundle] tag loads in the specified bundle.
Note, this file is relative to the directory where the IDV  is running.
You can provide an absolute path or even a URL as a file:
[isl::xml {
  <bundle file="/some/path/test.xidv"/>
  <bundle file="http://www.somesite.edu/test.xidv"/>
}
]

The file for the output image is also relative to where the IDV is running.
The type of image that is created is determined by the file suffix.
The IDV can generate <i>gif</i>, <i>jpg</i> and <i>png</i>. You can have multiple
[isl::tagref image] tags:

[isl::importxml multi.isl]


The [isl::tag isl] tag can have a loop and a sleep argument. The sleep
argument is the number of seconds to sleep after each iteration of the loop.
[isl::importxml loop.isl]
This  will loop through the set of commands 100 times. After each iteration of the loop
the IDV will sleep for 10 minutes (600 seconds).
<p>
Note: the above loop example will keep writing out to the  same image file. 
We can use the  macro expansion facility, described here: [isl::tagref property],
to change the file name every loop iteration:
[isl::importxml loop2.isl]
This will write out the images test0.png, test1.png, test2.png, etc.


<p>
One can use [isl::tagref group] tags to hold a set of children tags.
There can be any level of nesting. The [isl::tag group] tag can also
hold a [isl::attr loop] and [isl::attr sleep ] attribute
[isl::importxml nested.isl]
