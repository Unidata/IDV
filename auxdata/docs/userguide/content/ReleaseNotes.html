<faqitem  id="j8282" q="OpenJDK Java Version">

  <p>
    Due to the end of Oracle Java free release updates, the IDV project has
    officially moved from Oracle JDK to OpenJDK packages that receives support via the
    community. The AdoptOpenJDK provides prebuilt binaries from OpenJDK class libraries. All AdoptOpenJDK
    binaries and scripts are open source licensed and available for free. The version of the
    AdoptOpenJDK distributed with the IDV is 1.8.0_282. See
    the <a href=https://adoptopenjdk.net/> adoptOpenJDK Library</a> for a more details information.

<faqitem q="Latest netCDF-Java Version" id="nj465">

  <p>
    The version of the netCDF-Java library currently distributed with the IDV is
    the 5.5.3.  See
    the <a href="https://github.com/Unidata/netcdf-java/releases/tag/v5.5.3">
      netCDF-Java Library</a> for a more details information.

<faqitem id="radargriddisplay" q="Level II Radar Grid Displays">
  <p>
    New enhanced feature of level 2 radar grid display reads parameters from the level 2 volume scan radial dataset and
    interpolates onto a regular 3D Cartesian grid. The IDV performs an 8-point weighted interpolation. The 8 possible
    valid number of data points from 4 possible surrounding rays are identified through efficient searching algorithms.
    The resulting 3D Cartesian grid can be displayed as volume rendering, iso surface, cross section and plan view displays.
  </p>
</faqitem>

<faqitem id="pointcloudsngrids" q="Point Clouds and Point Grids" >
  <p>
    The IDV added a new data source type "Point Cloud Data" for CF netCDF station time series feature data and provides
    time series point clouds and point grids display for this type of point feature data. The IDV point cloud display
    shows large number (e.g. millions) point data as a set of points colored by parameter. The point grid efficiently
    interpolates the point station data onto the 2D regular grid and provide all 2D grided data visualization and analysis
    functions to this high dimensional data, including the scatter display and associated statistical analysis.
  </p>
</faqitem>

<faqitem id="nongeotimeseries" q="Non Geo Point Data" >
  <p>
    The IDV added support of non geo-located dataset. We added the support of displaying non-geolocated time series dataset.
    Furthermore, many statistical analyses of the current IDV formulas such as:  area average, level average, max, min, mean,
    percentile, and sum, the outputs of these analyses can now be generated as non geo-located data and exported as
    CSV or netCDF data formats. This new feature allows users to take advantage of the IDV flexible access of many data
    servers and prepare the data for purposes of machine learning and other scientific usages.

<faqitem id="addeupdate" q="ADDE Update">
  <p>
    We updated our ADDE services and moved towards making ADDE a service that can be moved to new systems while
    keeping the same service name adde.ucar.edu. We reduced and redefined some of ADDE dataset definitions that we
    maintain on all of our public-facing ADDE servers to increase the usability and persistence of dataset.
  </p>

<faqitem id="wmsupdate" q="IDV WMS Update">

  <p>
    There was a problem of connecting to the USGS WMS server in the past few releases with the error message of
    SSLHandshakeException. We identified the problem of the trustedCerts from the Unidata web server and remove
    the conflict of the SSLHandshake specification in the bundle libraries and create the new ramadda jar file.
    The new updated libraries in this release will provide accesses to many WMS servers in the IDV.

<faqitem id="wrfformulas" q="WRF NetCDF Formulas">
  <p>
    The original WRF netCDF output is in sigma coordinate. The current grid diagnostic formulas are mostly
    designed for the isobaric surface parameters. The newly added WRF derived formulas provide functions
    to directly create the derived parameters such as: Equivalent potential temperature, relative humidity,
    Saturated Equivalent potential temperature, dewpoint, and others.

<faqitem cat="Bug Fixes/Known Problems"></faqitem>

<faqitem q="Bug Fixes" id="bugfix">
  We fixed a bug associated with the excessive data loading in this release. Another
  bug fixed is to handle the redirect of the http urls.
