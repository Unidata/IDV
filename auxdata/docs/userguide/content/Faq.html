<faqitem q="What is the IDV?" name="top" id="whatis">

The Integrated Data Viewer (IDV) is a framework for
visualizing and analyzing geoscience data.   The IDV release includes a 
Java&#153;-based software library, and applications made from that software. 
It uses the <a href="http://www.ssec.wisc.edu/~billh/visad.html">VisAD</a>
library for data and display models as well as other Java utility
packages.  It was developed at the Unidata Program Center (UPC), part of the
University Corporation for Atmospheric Research, Boulder, Colorado, which
is funded by the National Science Foundation.  The software is
freely available under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public License.

<p>

The IDV brings together the ability to display 
and work with satellite imagery, gridded data (primarily from model output), 
and surface, upper air, and radar data within a unified interface. 
The IDV "reference application" provides many of the standard 
2-D data displays that other Unidata packages (e.g. GEMPAK and McIDAS) 
provide. It also provides 3-D views of the atmosphere and allows users 
to interactively slice, dice, and probe the data to create cross-sections, 
profiles, animations and value read-outs of multi-dimensional data sets.
Computation and display of built-in and user-supplied formula-based 
derived quantities is supported as well.
It includes an integrated HTML interface that can be used to create
HTML based users interfaces to drive the displays, or to embed IDV 
displays and controls directly in an HTML document.  

</faqitem>

<faqitem q="Is the IDV still under development?" id="idvfuture">

Development of the IDV is ongoing at the UPC and as it
progresses new features will be added and any problems/bugs will
be fixed. The development will be driven by the needs of the
community of users. Suggestions, comments and collaboration are welcomed
and encouraged.  The goal is to provide new and innovative ways
of displaying and analyzing data, as well as provide the common
displays that many users have come to expect.

<faqitem cat="Downloading and Starting with Web Start">

</faqitem>

<faqitem q="I couldn't download the IDV. Is the server down?" id="download">
Usually an inability to download the IDV and 
other Unidata software is due to a failure by your system to correctly
identify itself to our server.  
<p>

Both our server and the system trying to download Unidata software 
have a "name" (domain name or host name or server name) and an IP address.
For example the address 128.117.140.62 is the same as the server with
name  unidata.ucar.edu.

<p>

As a security measure many servers only reply to requests from systems
whose address can be matched to a name using "reverse lookup " -
turning the numbers into a name.

<p>

"Forward lookups" find the IP address of any given host name. The
reverse action is resolving IP addresses into host names. If our server
cannot resolve the requesting system IP address into a name, no software
will be sent to the requesting IP address.  If you are having problems
downloading the IDV from our server, check with your local system 
administrator to make sure that your machine has reverse lookup enabled.
If not, download the IDV from a system that does.

</faqitem>

<faqitem q="When I first run IDV through Web Start, it asks me to accept a certificate? What should I do?" id="certificate">
When you first download IDV through Web Start, you will see a message
like:

</pre>

If you trust Unidata to make safe software, click the [ht::command Start]
button

</faqitem>

<faqitem q="How can I get updates through Web Start?" id="updates">
When starting the IDV using Web Start, the latest version of all
IDV code is found at the Unidata server, and it is automatically 
downloaded and installed if it is newer than the version you have on 
your system. 
</faqitem>

<faqitem q="What is &quot;there is no disk in drive A&quot; message in Web Start?" id="nodisk">
Sometimes starting a program  on a Windows system with Web Start will
produce a dialog box that says "There is no disk in drive A." Normally
clicking the continue button will cause the program to start properly.
</faqitem>

<faqitem q="How do I use the Web Start Applications Manager?" id="wsmanager">
If you run the IDV from Web Start, for more control of the IDV, 
use the Web Start Application Manager. You can launch it by clicking
<a href="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/idv/webstart/IDV/player.jnlp">
here</a>. Alternatively, go to 
http://java.sun.com/products/javawebstart/demos.html, and
find the Web Start "Application Manager" on that page. Start the
"Application Manager" by clicking on the "Launch" button.
<p>

In the Application Manager you will see the 
IDV, if you do this after you have installed the IDV with Web Start.

<p>

You can use the Application Manager to start the IDV without going
to the Unidata web page Web Start link, and to remove an old IDV to
force a complete new IDV download next time you start the IDV with the
Unidata web page 
http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/idv/webstart/IDV/ .

<p>

If your Web Start IDV installation seems broken, remove it with the
Application Manager and reload from the IDV Web Start Link. When you
run the Application Manager it will have a panel showing "Integrated Data
Viewer" with an icon. Click to select and it will highlight; it may already be
selected. Use the 
[ug::menu Application {Remove Application}] menu. The IDV item will
go away. Reload the IDV from the Unidata web site.

<p>

You can see what Java version the IDV is using. Use the Application
Manager's [ug::menu File Preferences  Java] menu and look at "Product version."
</faqitem>

<faqitem q="How can I show the Java console when running with Web Start?" id="wsconsole">
When you start the IDV using Web Start, you don't have a console window
opened by default.  You can enable the Java console through the Web 
Start Applications Manager.  Bring up the Web Start Manager 
(Java Application Cache Viewer) as described <a href="#wsmanager">above</a>.  
Use the [ug::menu Edit Preferences] menu to bring up the Preferences dialog.  
Click on the Advanced Tab and expand the Java Console item in the tree.  Select
the "Show Console" option and then click the OK button.  The next time
you start the IDV with Web Start, you will get a console that will log
messages.  Messages are also logged to the IDV console.  See the
item <a href="#console">below</a> for information on using this feature.
</faqitem>

<faqitem q="Can I serve up JNLP bundles from my own web server?" id="ownws">
You can save a bundle as a JNLP file by using a .jnlp extension
in the [ug::mmenu File {Save As...}] menu dialog.  Once you have the
file, you can place it on your web server and create a web page
that points to it. Your web server must identify this as a JNLP file, 
so if it doesn't already support this, you'll need to configure your 
Web server so that all files with the .jnlp file extension are set to the 
application/x-java-jnlp-file MIME type.  Each Web server has a specific 
way in which to add MIME types. For example, for the Apache Web 
server you must add the following line to the .mime.types configuration file:

<pre>
application/x-java-jnlp-file JNLP
</pre>

Check the documentation for the specifics of your Web server.
</faqitem>

<faqitem cat="Using the IDV"></faqitem>


<faqitem q="How can I tell if the IDV is busy doing something?" id="busy">
The lower right corner of the main IDV view window shows a box with
progress bars IDV is busy making a display or doing anything.   In
the status bar at the bottom, messages will appear when the IDV is reading
data from a server or disk.  Also, while the displays are being created,
there is usually a "please wait" notice in the lower left corner
of the main display. 
</faqitem>

<faqitem q="How can I save a display?" id="savedisplay">

You can save images of displays as JPEG or PNG files or animations
as Quick Time movies or animated GIF's.
See <a href="tools/ImageCaptures.html">Image Captures</a>.

<p>

You can save particular IDV state with all displays, including data     
sources, displays, maps, map projection, view point, and color tables,  
by saving a "bundle" file with the 
[ug::mmenu File {Save As...}] menu, and naming a file. 
See <a 
href="Bundles.html">Saving State with Bundles</a>. A bundle file lets   
you reset the IDV to exactly the same state as before. The file can     
be emailed to others to recreate your IDV display, provided they have   
access to the same data source.                                         

<p>

Using the favorite <a href="Bundles.html">bundles</a>
 with [ug::menu File {Save As Favorite...}] menu you can
save and use several configurations which are retrieved with the 
[ug::menu Displays {Favorites}] menu.   
</faqitem>

<faqitem q="How can I change the start-up settings?" id="changestart">

You can customize many of the IDV properties through 
[ug::mmenu Edit Preferences] menu.  The preference
manager allows you to configure the many features of the IDV.<p>

You can also create a default IDV state and save it off using the 
bundle facility.  This allows you to override the preferences and
also include datasets and displays to load when the IDV starts.
To save a default bundle, use the 
[ug::mmenu File {Default Bundle} {Save}] menu.
See <a href="Bundles.html">Saving State with Bundles</a>.
</faqitem>

<faqitem q="How can I change the amount of memory available to the IDV?" id="memory">
By default, the IDV startup script (<b>runIDV</b> (Unix) or             
<b>runIDV.bat</b> (Windows)) allocates 512 megabytes of maximum memory  
for Java. If your system has more than 1 gigabyte of memory, increasing 
the amount of memory available to the IDV can improve performance for   
displaying large datasets. You can change the runIDV script to increase 
the amount of memory. In that script, change the <b>-Xmx512m</b> to     
some higher number (e.g. <b>-Xmx1024m</b>). The number is the number    
of bytes, the trailing <b>m</b> is a multiplier (m=mega). Do not use    
the maximum amount of memory on your machine as some is needed for      
the operating system itself. If the system has to use swap memory,      
performance will degrade as well.                                       
<p>

On a Mac, the procedure is a little more complicated because the
launcher does not use the runIDV script. In order to increase the
memory to say 1024 mb, you need to edit the Info.plist file in the IDV
application contents. To do this first go into the IDV folder in the
Applications folder and holding the Control button on the keyboard and
click on "IDV". For a 3-button mouse just right click. This will give
the Contents of the file in a new window. Then click on Contents folder.
You can edit the Info.plist file by dragging it into a text editor or
into a terminal window (type vi first). After the line VMOptions is the
memory setting "-Xmx512m". Change this to -Xmx1024m and save the file.
You can now launch the IDV by double clicking on the IDV application.
You should see 1024 MB as the allocated memory at the bottom of the IDV
window.
<p>

</faqitem>


<faqitem q="How can I change the size of the IDV window?" id="windowsize">
You can save particular IDV set-up including map, projection, 
With the IDV running, move and re-size the display and data source
windows to the arrangement you like. Save the 
"default bundle" with the 
[ug::mmenu File {Default Bundle} Save] menu. 
When you next start the IDV the same arrangement will appear. 
</faqitem>

<faqitem q="How can I reset the map projections?" id="projections">

When new data is displayed, the map projection will be automatically    
switched to match the native projection of the data. You can control    
this with the 
[ug::menu Projections {Auto-Set Projection}] menu check-box. 
You may not want this, especially when you have   
set up a view of a particular area which will be lost when new data is  
loaded. Check it off if you don't want it.                              

<P>
You can switch an existing display to its native data set projection
using the display control's [ug::menu View {Use Data Projection}] menu.
</faqitem>

<faqitem q="How can I set the default projection?" id="defaultprojection">

You can select a default map projection with the Projection Manager
which is accessed from the [ug::menu Projections {New/Edit}] menu.
Select one of the items in the <b>Default</b> pull down list. The 
default projection is overridden by a projection saved in the 
<a href="Bundles.html">default bundle</a>, and by resetting the map projection
with new data if enabled. As a result, you may never see the
default map projection. Make sure your default bundle has the default
projection, and you have the menu item 
[ug::menu Projections {Auto-Set Projection}] menu checked off.
Choosing a default map projection is not necessary for good use of the IDV
and you can ignore it if you like. It is often simpler to use default bundles.
</faqitem>

<faqitem q="How can I change the color table range?" id="colorrange">

Many displays have a color table controlling the colors of data values. 
A color table has a range of minimum and maximum data values. You       
can change the range for a display by right clicking on the color bar
in the display's legend and selecting the [ug::menu {Change Range...}]
menu from the popup menu.  For more information on controlling the
color table, see the <a href="tools/ColorTableEditor.html">Color
Table Editor</a> documentation.</faqitem>                                        
<faqitem q="How can stop the IDV from asking if I really want to exit?" id="noaskexit">
You can change many features of the IDV though the User Preferences
dialog.  Use the [ug::mmenu Edit Preferences]
menu to bring up the dialog.  On the <code class="command">General</code> tab,
uncheck the &quot;Confirm Before Exiting&quot; box to stop the
IDV from asking if you want to exit.
</faqitem>                                        

<faqitem q="When I set a color table transparent, why doesn't it show up that way?" id="transparency">
Using transparency in a color display may give unexpected results.
In general, only the last thing added can be fully transparent.
If you have a display that is transparent, then add in a new display,
you may not see it.  The problem is caused by the lack of ordering
in Java 3D.   You can use the display control's View-&gt;Bring to Front
menu to remove and re-add the display that you want to be transparent 
so it is last.
</faqitem>


<faqitem cat="Data"></faqitem>

<faqitem q="What is Fast Rendering and when should I use it?" id="fastrender">
By default, the IDV will try to adjust the data renderings to account
for projection seams.  This is computationally intensive in some 
cases and slows down the display of data.  When you set your preference
to &quot;Use Fast Rendering&quot;, the IDV will not try to account
for the projection seams.  If you are displaying data in its
native projection, this will result in faster rendering of the data
depiction.  However, if you have several displays of data, each
from a different data source and on a different projection, you may
see anomalies in the displays (spurious lines, portions of images).
At that point, you can turn off fast rendering for a particular display
using the Edit-&gt;Properties menu of the Display Control for that
display, or set your system preference back to not use fast rendering.
</faqitem>

<faqitem q="What is the difference between true wind vectors and regular wind vectors?" id="truewind">
Some gridded data is produced with the wind components being
relative to the model grid instead of the earth.  The true wind vectors 
are rotated from the grid projection to actual (true) wind direction.  
For non-projected (i.e., lat/lon grids), grid relative is the same as true.
</faqitem>

<faqitem q="What is the difference between the Standard Atmosphere 
and logarithmic pressure to height conversion?" id="pressure_to_height">
The IDV displays pressure surfaces by converting the pressure
to a height in some reference system.  There are two reference
systems that come standard with the IDV - the U.S. Standard Atmosphere
and a logarithmic conversion (also used in Vis5D).  The U.S. Standard 
Atmosphere only computes conversions for pressures up to about 80 km.  
The logarithmic coordinate system uses the following equations:
<pre>
      P = 1012.5 * e^( H / -7.2 )        (^ denotes exponentiation)
      H = -7.2 * Ln( P / 1012.5 )        (Ln denotes natural log)
</pre>
so can be used for heights above 80 km.  
</faqitem>

<faqitem q="Can I view Level III Radar data in the IDV?" id="level3">
The IDV can load Level III radar products through the 
<b>Radar-&gt;Level III</b> chooser which connects to an ADDE
server.  Starting with the 2.0 release, the IDV can read
some Level III products from local disk or a THREDDS Data Server (TDS).
At present, this is limited to radial products only.
</faqitem>

<faqitem q="Can I view Level II Radar data in the IDV?" id="level2">

The IDV can be used to create displays of WSR-88D Archive Level II
radar data.  The Level II data is supplied as volume-scan files,                each file having all data from one WSR-88D radar                        
for all sweeps for one &quot;time&quot;. Unidata                        
Community sites can receive Level II data using the <a                  
href="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/ldm/index.html">      
Unidata Local Data Manager (LDM)</a>. Archived Level II data is         
available from the <a href="http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/"> National        
Climatic Data Center (NCDC)</a>.<p>

The files should be stored on your file system with each station's files 
in a directory (folder) whose directory name is the station 
4-character ID (e.g., KTLX for Oklahoma City).  In some cases the data
files do not have any location information in them and the IDV uses the
directory name as a first guess at the station location.   
</faqitem>

<faqitem q="Why do I get an error when I try to load radar
data that I downloaded from NCDC?">

There are few common problems that can cause this:

<ol>

<li><b>The files are in a compressed tar file</b> - 
Typically, when you download Level II data from NCDC, the files
are in a compressed TAR file which holds the individual volume scans.
You need to extract the volumes from the TAR file with utilities 
like tar, gunzip, WinZip into a directory as described in the 
previous FAQ item. </li>

<li><b>You are using the Files chooser</b>
You should load the radar data using the Level II data
chooser in the Data Source Chooser, not the Files chooser.
In some cases, the files do not have any location information in
them.  The Level II data chooser allows you to associated a station
location with the data file, using the directory name as a first
guess.</li>

<li><b>You are trying to load Level III raster products</b>
The IDV only handles the Level III data that is stored in
radial format (Base Reflectivity, Storm Relative Velocity,
Base Velocity, 1 and 3 hour precipitation, Echo Tops).
</li>

</ol>
</faqitem>

<faqitem q="When I try to read in my GRIB data, why do I get an
ucar.grib.NotSupportedException?" id="gribtables">
For the IDV to read in GRIB data, it needs access to lookup
tables for decoding the information in the data.  The IDV comes
pre-configured with most of the commonly used tables from NCEP,
FNMOC, etc, but some GRIB data from regional centers may use
tables other than the defaults.  If the IDV does not have 
the necessary table, you will get the NotSupportedException.
You can add in new tables by following the instructions in the 
User's Guide section on
<a href="data/GribTables.html">Adding in new GRIB tables</a>.
</faqitem>

<faqitem q="How are grids resampled in the IDV?" id="resample">
The IDV uses two methods for resampling data - weighted
average and nearest neighbor.  These are the default sampling
mode for VisAD which the IDV is based on.  For any grid,
the samples are organized in a topology, which may be
triangles (Irregular2D), squares (Gridded2D), tetrahedra
(Irregular3D) or cubes (Gridded3D). For target points
the system finds which topology element contains the
target. For nearest neighbor, it gets the values at the
vertex of that containing topology element closest to the
target point. For weighted average, its computes a
weighted average of all vertices of that containing
topology element, where the weights are bilinear in
2-D and trilinear in 3-D. (source: Bill Hibbard, SSEC)

</faqitem>

<faqitem cat="Video Cards"></faqitem>

<faqitem q="Do I need a special video card to run the IDV?" id="videocard">
Your video card must support OpenGL (or Direct-X if you are
using the Direct-X version of Java 3D).  If you experience
problems with IDV displays (sets of triangles, spurious lines,
weird looking displays), make sure your video driver is up to date.  
See your system's documentation for how to check that.
</faqitem>

<faqitem q="The display goes grey or gets corrupted when I resize my
IDV display. What's wrong?" id="badvideo">
ATI cards do not always play nicely with the OpenGL version of
Java 3D under Windows.  If you experience problems with corrupted 
displays (sets of triangles, spurious lines, weird looking displays)
and have an ATI card and are running Windows, try the following:<p>
<ul>
<li>Right click on the Windows Desktop and select Properties from the
pop-up menu.
<li>From the Settings tab, make sure the color quality is 16 bit.  
<li>Click the Advanced button and select the OpenGL tab.  Depending 
    on your card, either click the button for Force 16 bit buffer 
    (or something like that) or click on the Compatibility settings 
    button and click the "Force 16 bit" radio button.
<li>Click the OK buttons to exit the Display Properties dialog.
<li>Try the IDV again and see if it works better
<li>If not, try using the Direct-X installer instead of the OpenGL 
    installer.
</ul>
</faqitem>

<faqitem q="I'm having problems with the OpenGL verion under Windows.
How can I run the Direct-X version Java 3D?" id="d3d">
If you are using the version of Java 3D distributed with the IDV
(1.3.2), you can switch between the OpenGL and Direct-X versions
of Java 3D with a command line switch.  
If you are using runIDV.bat to start the IDV, edit that file and
uncomment the appropriate line.  If you have your own script
for  starting the IDV, add in the <b>-Dj3d.rend=d3d</b> option 
to your start line (before -jar or class name).  
</faqitem>

<faqitem q="Does the IDV support 3D Stereo?" id="stereo">

The Java 3D library which the IDV uses supports stereo on properly
configured stereo devices. We have added   
the necessary code to allow stereo to work in certain configurations.
At present, the Unidata Program Center does not have access to a stereo 
system like a GeoWall, so our experience testing with these systems 
is limited.  You will need to modify the runIDV script to change the 
<code class="command">-Didv.enableStereo=false</code> to be 
<code class="command">-Didv.enableStereo=true</code> before 
starting the IDV.  
If your runIDV script does not have the
<code class="command">-Didv.enableStereo=false</code>
argument in it then  change:
<pre>
command="java -Xmx512m -jar idv.jar $*"
</pre>
to:
<pre>
command="java -Xmx512m -Didv.enableStereo=true -jar idv.jar $*"
</pre>
<p>
After doing this, if you bring up the IDV on a 
stereo device and it does not appear to be in stereo, use the 
<a href="ui/Navigation.html#viewpoint"> Viewpoint Toolbar</a> 
to set the display to a perspective view.
</faqitem>

<faqitem q="My stereo display only seems to use one eye of the glasses.  How 
do I fix this?" id="one-eye">

Some stereo cards do not keep a separate Z-buffer per eye.  If you 
are experiencing problems, try changing the line in the runIDV script to:

<pre>
command="java -Xmx512m -Didv.enableStereo=true -Dj3d.sharedstereozbuffer=true -jar idv.jar $*"
</pre>

</faqitem>

<faqitem cat="Potential Problems"></faqitem>

<faqitem q="How do I connect to remote servers through my firewall?" id="firewall">
If you have a firewall and you try to get data from the remote
servers (image, radar, point, upper air and profiler data), you may get error
messages such as "Error opening connection ... Operation timed out" 
or "No Data Available."  For these servers to send data, your
firewall software must allow connections on ports 112 (ADDE) and 8080
(THREDDS Data Server).
</faqitem>

<faqitem q="I get an error that starts something like &quot;Unexpected Signal : 11 occurred at PC=0x6F79CE1&quot; when starting the IDV under Linux.  What does this mean?" id="dri">
If the error message also includes a line that is looking for a 
Library with &quot;dri&quot; in it's name
(e.g.: Library=/usr/X11R6/lib/modules/dri/i915_dri.so), it means
that you are trying to load the DRI library in your X server which
is not compatible with Java 3D.  You need to comment out the line:
<p>
<ul>
        Load  &quot;dri&quot;
</ul>
<p>
in your X server configuration file (xorg.conf or XF86Config).

<faqitem q="The IDV has locked up and is not responding. What do I do?" id="lockup">

You can either close the windows or, if that does not work, remove (on Windows) the <i>java.exe</i> process through  the Windows Task Manager  or by killing the process on Linux/Unix.
<p>
However, before you do that we want to find out why it locked up. To do this we need you to get a stack trace
of the program and send it to us at <a href="mailto:support-idv@unidata.ucar.edu">support-idv@unidata.ucar.edu</a>.
<p>
On Windows do a <i>control-break</i> key in the  IDV terminal window and copy/paste the result.
<p>
On Linux/Unix either do a <i>control-/</i> in the terminal window or do a <i>kill -3 &lt;java process id&gt;</i>
<p>
At this time we're not sure how to do this on a Mac.
