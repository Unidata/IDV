The IDV supports the capture and playback of user interface events.
Use the [ug::menu File {Event Capture}] menu item to show
the event capture window:

[ht::cimg images/EventCaptureDialog.gif {Event Capture Window}]

When you press the [ug::button Start Capture] button all events will be captured.
For example, you could load in a data source, create a display, and navigate through
the 3D space. 
<p>
When you are done press [ug::button Stop Capture]. 
Press [ug::button Write Captured Events] to save the series of events to a file.
Press [ug::button Clear Captured Events] to empty the list of cached events.

<p>
You can load in a capture file with the 
[ug::button Load Captured Events] button. Once loaded in the capture can be
replayed with the control buttons.
