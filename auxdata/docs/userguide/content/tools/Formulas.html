The IDV provides techniques to make computations with
data sources, and display the results.
The simplest technique is using IDV "formulas" which are named one-line
mathematical expressions.
The steps for computing and displaying an IDV formula are 

<ul>
<li> Defining an IDV formula by name, description, and 
mathematical formula.
<li> Saving the formula.
<li> Selecting what kind of display to use.
<li> Selecting exactly which particular data you want to
use in the formula-based computation.
</ul>

You can make formulas more powerful by writing methods
(subroutines) in the Jython computer language, which is described in
<a href="Jython.html">Jython Methods</a>.

<p>

When you define an IDV formula, it is saved and will appear in
future runs of your IDV. 
<P>

To create a formula select the [ug::menu Edit Formulas {Create Formula}] 
menu item. This brings  up the <b>Formula Editor</b> dialog box
used to define a formula:

[ht::cimg images/formula/AddFormula.gif]

The minimal information you need to provide is the name
of the formula and the actual formula.
<p>

If the formula name matches a name in the main Edit Menu 
<a href="../ui/Menus.html#edit"><b>Parameter defaults</b></a>, then
color tables and other settings may be automatically assigned, which
may or may not be desirable for you. For example, if you choose a
formula named T its displays would get the color tables associated with 
temperature.

<p>

In the formula itself you can use common 
mathematical operators much as +, -, * for multiply, / for divide, 
and ** for power. Other Jython operations such as sqrt(a), max(b), pow(a,b), 
and sin(c) are available. In the 
<a href="Jython.html">Jython Methods</a>
section of the User Guide
you will see how to write complete complete multi-line functions or 
methods in Jython  that you can call in one-line formulas.


<p>

The variable 
names in the formula definition, such as &quot;NIR&quot; in the figure above,  
are  operands and do <i>not</i> need to 
exactly match any particular parameter name in any data source; the 
association is made later, in the parameter selection step.
<p>

Do not use spaces in formula variable names, such
as "wind speed." The formula is an expression in the
Jython language.  Start each variable name with a letter.

<p>


It is best to use variable names that suggest the parameter data
they represent, so that later you can easily remember
what the variables should represent. 
<p>
Variable names can have extra &quot;syntactic sugar&quot; attached to
them that the IDV uses for a variety of purposes. The &quot;sugar&quot;
consists of a set of name/value pairs contained 
in brackets (&quot;\[...\]&quot;) after the variable name.
<p>

You can specify a label that is shown in the user interface:
<pre>
   someProcedure(someDataValue\[label=The label to use\])
</pre>



You can specify the types of data that can be selected for a variable
with the <i>categories</i> name.  e.g.:
<pre>
   someProcedure(someDataValue\[categories=param:ALTITUDE\])
</pre>

If you want multiple data categories separate them with a &quot;;&quot;:
<pre>
   someProcedure(someDataValue\[categories=param:ALTITUDE;param:elevation\])
</pre>

If you only want to select 3D grids do:
<pre>
   someProcedure(someDataValue\[categories=GRID-3D-*\])
</pre>

If you only want to select 3D or 2D grids do:
<pre>
   someProcedure(someDataValue\[categories=GRID-3D-*;GRID-2D-*"\])
</pre>


You can also specify a regular expression pattern that is used
to pre-select the first data choice  whose description
matches the pattern.
<pre>
   someProcedure(someValue\[pattern=some_pattern\])
</pre>



Not only can you specify fields from data source you can also define that certain operands
are text and other values from the user with the &quot;isuser=true&quot; operand attribute.
For  example, evaluating the following expression:
<pre>
   someProcedure(someValue\[isuser=true\])
</pre>
will result in a dialog box being shown to allow  for the user to enter
a text value (e.g., a number) for the variable <i>someValue</i>.

<p>

You can provide default values with:
<pre>
   someProcedure(someValue\[isuser=true,default=some default\])
</pre>


If you wanted to have a multiple line  text area for input you do:
<pre>
   someProcedure(someValue\[isuser=true,rows=5\])
</pre>

You can use the &quot;type&quot; attribute to define other types of input.
For example, if you wanted to have a checkbox you do:
<pre>
   someProcedure(someValue\[isuser=true,type=boolean\])
</pre>

A menu of choices can be constructed with:
<pre>
   someProcedure(someValue\[isuser=true,type=choice,choices=Apples;Bananas;Oranges;\])
</pre>

A latitude/longitude can be chosen:
<pre>
   someProcedure(someValue\[isuser=true,type=location,default=40;-107\])
</pre>

<p>
You can support multiple selection of fields using:
<pre>
   someProcedure(someValue\[multiple=true\])
</pre>
This will result in a field selector with a list of selected fields at the bottom. When enabled you can double click on a field to add it.
The actual object that gets passed to the formula Jython code is a list of the fields.



<p>
In the advanced section you can enter a description of the formula,
its group or category and you can  define what types of displays 
are applicable  for the given formula (the default is to be able to 
use all displays).

<p>
The group is used to display the formula in the 
Field Selector window and  can be any alphanumeric 
text including spaces, numbers, and punctuation characters.
Hyphens (&quot;-&quot;) define sub-categories.


<p>
To save the formula, click on <b>Add formula</b>. 
A new entry appears in the selector panel. By right clicking on the formula
entry in the Field Selector window you can edit the formula.
To remove a formula, click on <b>Remove Formula</b> in the pull
down menu.


<h3>Different data sources and automatic navigation</h3>

The IDV hides much of the computational complexity. You
can write a simple formula such as (CT*1.8 + 32.0) - dewptF and the IDV will
automatically apply the calculation to every element in large 3D
grids referred to as CT and dewptF. No loops over grid points are needed;
and you don't even need to know anything about how the grid is 
defined, mapped on the Earth, 
or the data format.  You can even use different sources for the
individual parameters, for example, CT can come from an Eta model output 
grid and dewptF from your own local weather model. The two grids need hot have
the same grid point locations nor the same areal coverage. The results
are computed in the area of overlap, on the grid points locations of the
first grid. Interpolation is automatically applied where needed.


<h3>Creating a Display with a Formula</h3>

Using a formula as the data when creating a display is just
like using any other data. You select the formula entry
in the Field Selector window, the list of applicable displays
will be shown and you create the display.
<p>
When you create a display the IDV needs to know what actual 
data should be bound to the operands within your formula.
A Field Selector window will appear that allows you
to select the actual data for each operand.
You can select parameters from more than one data source for 
use in a single formula,
for example, you can pick the same parameter from data sources of
different times to compute a time difference in the parameter.

[ht::cimg images/formula/FormulaParameterSelect.gif]


Open the data source to see the names of 
parameters available. Click on the parameter needed for each
variable. Then click on <b>OK</b>. The 
result of the formula is computed, for
every data point in the source, and the
result shown in the view window.

<h3>Wind Chill Example</h3>

Here is an example of a formula using the new (2001) JAG-TI wind chill formula.

[ht::cimg images/formula/WindchillFormula.gif]

Whoa!  That's no good. A temperature of 340 Kelvin is too
hot. What went wrong?  We forgot about units. The temperature data is in
Kelvins, and the wind speed is in m/s. The formula needs Celsius and
kilometers per hour. So we have to build unit conversion into the
formula. Use (T-273.15) for temperature and 3.6*WS for windspeed.
Here is the result:

[ht::cimg images/formula/Windchill2.gif]

That's OK now. The IDV took about a minute to compute and display this wind
chill formula
for the full 3D Eta 211 grids of temperature, u and v,  for 10 time
steps (1,148,550 data points).

<p>

For a further example, the air temperature was subtracted from the
computed wind chill.  Two displays of this data, "apparent temperature 
change due to wind chill" are shown below: contours
and a colored image. Wind vectors were also displayed. Your students 
can look for connections between wind chill depression below
temperature and wind speed. It is also  useful to plot contoured  air
temperature, and toggle among the displays to help understand the relationships.
