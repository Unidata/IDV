<div class="overview">
This page summarizes use of the Time Animation Widget for controlling
animations in IDV displays. 
</div>

<a name="animation"></a>
<div class="pagesubtitle">Time Animation Widget</div>

Each IDV view window has a set of time animation controls 
above the view window.

The [ht::command Time Animation Widget] controls 
looping of displays through time when more than one data time is 
loaded. The time of the data is displayed in the labeled 
pull-down list on the left. The toolbar of button icons, on the right,
controls time animation. Each button works as follows:

<ul>
<li><img src="images/Rewind16.gif"> - Show the first frame, 
     and stop looping if looping is on.</li>
<li><img src="images/StepBack16.gif"> - Step Back one frame.</li>
<li><img src="images/Play16.gif">/<img src="images/Pause16.gif"> - Toggle 
    looping on or off. The icon switches between <img src="images/Play16.gif">
    (start looping) and <img src="images/Pause16.gif"> (stop looping).</li>
<li><img src="images/StepForward16.gif"> - Step Forward one frame.</li>
<li><img src="images/FastForward16.gif"> - Show the last frame, and 
    stop looping if looping is on.</li>
<li><img src="images/Information16.gif"> - Show the Animation Properties 
    dialog box. </li>
</ul>

<div class="pagesubtitle">Time Animation Properties Dialog</div>

Click on the <img src="images/Information16.gif"> in the 
<code class="command">Time Animation Widget</code>
to see the <code class="dialog">Time Animation Properties</code> editor.

<p><center><img src="images/AnimationProperties.gif" ></center><p>

The <code class="dialog">Time Animation Properties</code> editor allows you
to change the values that control looping. Drag the top four
scroll bars to change their value. The properties include:

<ul>
<li><code class="command">Forward Dwell </code> controls speed of 
    looping forward (seconds/frame); dwell is how long each 
    frame is seen when looping</li>

<li><code class="command">Backward Dwell </code> controls speed of 
    looping backwards (seconds/frame)</li>
<li><code class="command">First Dwell </code> how long first frame 
    is seen (seconds)</li>
<li><code class="command">Last Dwell </code>  how long last 
    frame is seen (seconds)</li>
</ul>

<p>

You can set the loop Direction:
<ul>

<li>[ht::button Forward]  click this button to 
    loop forward in time</li>

<li>[ht::button Backward] click this button to 
    loop backward in time</li>

<li>[ht::button Rocking] click this button to 
    enable rocking, where looping alternates between forward and 
    backward directions.</li>

</ul>


The [ht::command Share Times] options are used 
to toggle sharing of animations among displays.  You can disable
sharing [ht::command None], share by [ht::command Absolute] time
or by [ht::command Relative] indices between two displays.
You can group different animation widgets and share among the group with 
the [ht::command Group] box.

The [ht::command Boxes Visible] checkbox is used 
to show or hide the animation step boxes on the Time Animation Widget.<p>

The [ht::command Skip Steps] boxes allow you to
skip time steps in the sequence.  Right click on a yellow box to
skip that step and it will turn red.  Right click on a red box
and it will become yellow, indicating that the step is active.<p>

The [ht::command Reset To] menu allows you to select what happens when new data/times
are added to the display. e.g., reset to beginning time, reset to last time, keep 
at orginal time.



<div class="pagesubtitle">Defining Custom Animation Sets</div>
Normally, all of the different times in a display are used to
create the set of times that are looped through. However,
the second tab in the Animation Properties dialog allows the user to define custom
animation sets:

[ht::cimg images/AnimationProperties2.gif -caption {Define Animation Times Tab}]


To define your own time set select the [ht::button Define your own list of times] button. 
The basic idea is that you define a start time, and end time and a time interval.
These times can be set from the data, from a fixed time,  the current time and
relative to each other. An offset (both positive and negative) can be defined as well
by clicking on the edit button: <img src="%dotpath%/images/edit.gif">.

<p>
A simple case would be if you have a mix of satellite imagery (every 15 mintues) and radar (every 7 minutes).
You could choose the start time and end time to be  set from the data. And you interval could be 5 minutes.
This would provide a uniform animation.
<p>
Another example is if you are displaying  real time data (e.g., aircraft track) and you want
to see the last hour at minute increments. In this case your end time  would be &quot;Current Time (Now)&quot;.
You start time would be &quot;Relative to End Time&quot; with an offest of - 1 hour.
Your interval would be 1 minute.
<p> For real time you can define a refresh rate (e.g., every 5 minutes). This will automatically update the current time
and rebuild the animation time set.

<p> The [ht::command Round To] time can round the base times. e.g., to the nearest minute, hour, day, etc.
