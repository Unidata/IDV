<faq qlabel=" " alabel=" ">

<faqitem cat="System Changes"></faqitem>

<faqitem q="Use of netCDF 4.0 library" id="whatsnext">
The IDV now uses the Java-netCDF 4.0 library. This provides
limited support for HDF-4 and HDF-5 files.</li>
</faqitem>

<faqitem q="Use of Java 1.6" id="jdk6">
The IDV installers now use Java 6.  Web Start still uses Java 5
(JDK 1.5) since there is no version of Java 6 on Mac OS-X for
older systems.</li>
</faqitem>

<faqitem cat="Display Changes"></faqitem>
<faqitem q="Publication Quality Graphics" id="vector graphics">
Any display can now be saved in a vector graphics (PDF, PostScript,
Scalar Vector Graphics (SVG)) format.  Use the [ug::menu View Capture Image]
menu and use .pdf, .ps or .svg for the file suffix to create the
appropriate format.  This works best for overhead,
line plots.  For 3D plots, raster (e.g. GIF, PNG, JPEG) is still the
best option.  This work was made possible using code from the
Australian Bureau of Meteorology.
</faqitem>

<faqitem cat="Data Changes"></faqitem>
<faqitem q="Remote Level III Radar access" id="remotelevel3">
The chooser for the Level II data from the THREDDS Data Server (TDS)
can now be used to access Level III products as well.  This provides
faster access than the ADDE server and allows you to access data
across days.
</faqitem>

<faqitem q="Objective Analysis of Point Data" id="oabarnes">
Point data (observations) can now be gridded using a Barnes
objective analysis routine.  Numeric fields are listed under
a "Gridded Data" category in the Field Selector.  Users can control
the analysis parameters through the Data Source properties or
through the Data Subset panel.  This work was made possible using 
code from the Australian Bureau of Meteorology.
</faqitem>

<faqitem q="Weather Text Products" id="wxtext">
Users can now access weather text products from a remote server
or their own local archives.  The server products use the ADDE
protocol.  The local archives are based on the GEMPAK NWX tables.
For the latter, you must have GEMPAK installed and have the
appropriate environment variables defined for the NWX program.
Information on using the display control can be found in the
<a href="controls/misc/TextProductControl.html">Text Product
Control</a> documentation.
</faqitem>

<faqitem q="ATCF Tropical Storm track display" id="atcf">
Users can access the Automated Tropical Cyclone Forecasting (ATCF) data 
from the National Hurricane Center in the IDV.  This archive has
historical storm tracks back to the 1800's.  Use the
[ug::menu Data {Load Data} {ATCF Storm Tracks}] menu to access
this feature.  The resulting display allows you to compare model
forecasts in the database.
