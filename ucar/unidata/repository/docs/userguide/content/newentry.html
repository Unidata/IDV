[ht::head {Creating Groups and Entries}]

<%nochildlist%>

When you are logged in and you have the access to create a new group or
entry under the group that you are viewing there will be a set of links under the File menu
that allows you to create a new File, Group or some other Entry type:

[ht::cimg images/filemenu.gif {}  {border=0}]


Choosing &quot;New Entry&quot; takes you to this page:

[ht::cimg images/createentry.gif {}  {border=0}]

You can directly create a group, upload a file or select a specific entry type in the form.


<p>

Selecting the &quot;Create a group&quot; link will take you to the
create group form:

[ht::cimg images/newgroupform.gif {} {border=0 width=600}]

Enter a name and an optional description, date range and lat/lon bounding box.


<subhead intoc="false" id="createentry">Uploading Files</subhead>
To upload a file to a RAMADDA repository you create a new Entry.
From the File menu select  &quot;New File&quot;.


The Create Entry form allows you to upload a file or specify a URL.
If you are a site administrator you can also specify a path to
a file on the server machine.

[ht::cimg images/newentryform.gif {} {border=0 width=600}]

The minimal you need to enter here is the file or URL. The other fields
are optional. If you do not enter a name then the file name is used.
<p>
If you have a number of files that you want to upload you can make a .zip file
of them on your machine and check on the &quot; Unzip Archive&quot; button.
<p>
If you are uploading a netcdf file (or another data type that can be opened,
e.g., grib, radar, area file, etc) checking &quot;Add Metadata&quot;
will have RAMADDA crack open the file and harvest the time range, lat/lon
bounding box, global attributes and variables and add them as Metadata of
this Entry.
See the section on <a href="editing.html#autometadata">metadata</a>  for more information.

<p>
The &quot;Data Type&quot; is an optional and arbitrary data type  that can 
be used to search for entries of this type.
<p>
The &quot;Date Pattern&quot; can be used to match on the file name to automatically 
figure out the date of this entry. 



<subhead intoc="false" id="importcatalog">Importing a THREDDS Catalog</subhead>

If you are a site administrator the New Entry page will also show a form that allows you to import  a
THREDDS catalog from an external server:
[ht::cimg images/catalogimport.gif {}  {border=0}]
Enter a URL to a THREDDS catalog. The Recurse  checkbox determines whether catalog references
will be followed. If you select Download URLS RAMADDA will try to download the files if possible.
<p>
This create a special <a href="harvesters.html"> THREDDS Catalog Harvester</a> that can be monitored
from the Admin Harvesters page.
