The  [ug::chooser Images] chooser allows you to access 
satellite imagery on remote ADDE servers.  

[ht::cimg images/ImageChooser.gif {Image Chooser}]

To select images:

<ol>

[ug::step "Choose an ADDE [ug::menu Server] and a [ug::menu Dataset] to use. Press [ug::button Connect] to query the server for available image types" images/ImageStep1.gif {The IDV comes pre-configured with a list of ADDE servers and data sets or you can enter
your own. See  <a href="DataSources.html">Available data</a> for a description
of these pre-defined data sets.}]


[ug::step "Select the [ug::menu {Image Type}] to use:" images/ImageStep3.gif]

[ug::step {Either, choose a relative set of times steps (e.g., Last 5 times):} images/ImageStep4.gif]

[ug::step {Or, choose a set of absolute times (e.g., 12Z, 1Z):} images/ImageStep5.gif {
When choosing 
absolute times for the first time the IDV needs to query the ADDE server 
for the times. This may take some time.  
Times can be selected in the list or the time line
(use control/click or shift/click in the list to select multiple times).
See the <a href="../../tools/Timeline.html">Timeline section</a> for details on its use.
}]


[ug::step {Optionally override the image selection properties
(e.g., image size, location, etc.) See below for more details.}]

[ug::step "When done, load the selected image data with the [ug::button Add Source] button."]


</ol>


<div class="pagesubtitle">Image Properties</div>

The Properties section allows you to override the default properties the
IDV uses to specify other aspects of the image data.  The widgets show
the defaults the IDV will use.  By changing any of the widgets 
you can override the default value.

<p>

You can specify the data type that is to be returned (e.g., 
<b>BRIGHTNESS</b>, <b>RAW</b>) from the <b>Data Type</b> pull-down list.
If the image has multiple channels you can also
choose which  channel to use.
<p>

You can specify the placement point of the image (e.g., Center, Upper Left)
and its  location. Location can either be specified as an Line/Element 
coordinate or as Latitude/Longitude.  Use the cycle buttons to select
the type of location to use.
<p>
Image size and magnification can also be set.  Click on the slider
icon to change the values.

<p>

The Full Resolution button: <img src="images/arrow_out.png"> allows you to set the magnifcation,
image size and position to be the full image resolution.
