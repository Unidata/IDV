<h2>Installing and Running the Unidata IDV with Web Start </h2>
</center>

<p> This web page explains how to install and run the Unidata
<b>Integrated Data Viewer (IDV) </b> using Java Web Start. 
If you already have Web Start installed on your machine then
<a href="idv.jnlp">click here</a> to launch the IDV.</a>

<p>


The Unidata IDV is the reference application for the Integrated
Data Viewer Framework making general tools for
displaying geo-referenced datasets. See the <a
href="https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/idv/docs/userguide/index.html">User Guide</a> for an overview of the IDV.

<b>Java Web Start</b> is an application-deployment technology that
downloads all software needed from the Web and then starts the
application. You do not need to set up directories, or FTP files, or
configure anything - Web Start does it for you. <p>

To run the IDV through Java Web Start just follow these steps:

<ol>

<li><b>Read the system requirements.</b>
<br>Before starting, please see the <a
href="https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/idv/docs/userguide/Systems.html">
System Requirements</a> to ensure that your machine is
capable of running the IDV.

<p> 

<li><b>Install Web Start</b><br>
<ul>
<li>If you are Windows, Solaris/SPARC or Linux, go to the 
<a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp"> Sun J2SE
download page</a>. Download and install the latest version of the Java
Runtime Environment (JRE) for your platform. The JRE includes Web Start.
All you need is the JRE. (You don't need the SDK, NetBeans or any of
the other myriad of options Sun provides; they are mainly for Java
developers.) Depending on your platform, after clicking on the latest
JRE download option, you might get a license agreement screen. If you
accept the terms, it will take you to the actual download page where you
click on the download appropriate for your platform. The download page
explains different options for "online" or "offline" installation, etc.
But, in general, the installation process will be similar to that for
installing other software packages on your machine.
If you are running Windows, Web Start will download everything you need.</li>

<li>
If you are running Mac OS-X (version 10.3.1 or later),
Web Start is already installed.  If you are running on a version
less than 10.4.0 you will need to download and install the 
Java 3D Update available <a
href="http://www.apple.com/downloads/macosx/apple/java3dandjavaadvancedimagingupdate.html">here</a>.

<li> For other systems, Web Start is not available, so go to the <a
href="https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/idv/docs/userguide/Starting.html">Downloading and Running the IDV</a>section of the Users
Guide and use either the InstallAnywhere installers or the manual
installation.</li>

</ul>

<p>

<li><b>Run the IDV</b><br> <a href="idv.jnlp">Click here to launch the
IDV</a>. Once Web Start is installed, you only click here to start the
IDV every time. </ol>



For additional information on starting the IDV through Web Start,
see the <a href="https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/idv/docs/userguide/">IDV User's Guide</a>
and the <a href="https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/idv/docs/userguide/Faq.html">FAQ</a>.
