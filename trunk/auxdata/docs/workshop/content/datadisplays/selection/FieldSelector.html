<title>Using the Field Selector</title>
</head>

<body>

<div class="overview">
The Field Selector is used to select data sources, parameters,
data times, and types of displays to use for creating visualizations.
</div>

<div class="pagesubtitle">Field Selector</div>

<p>The [ht::tab Field Selector] consists of 4
panels:

<ul class="step">

  <li>[ht::command Data Sources] - used for selecting
      data sources that are currently loaded into the IDV. 
      [ht::dataset Formulas] is a particular
      data source for applying formulas to other data sources.</li>

  <li>[ht::command Fields] - displays the list of
      data choices (parameters, formulas) for the selected data source.</li>

  <li>[ht::command Displays] - holds the list of
      display types applicable to the selected field.</li>

  <li>[ht::command Data Subset] - depending on the type of data,
      this panel displays the list of times, levels and spatial subsetting
      associated with the selected data choice.</li>

</ul>

<div class="pagesubtitle">Data Sources</div>

When the IDV reads in a data source, most of the time it only reads
enough metadata to be able to create a list of [ht::param data choices]. 
Some of the datasets may be quite large and this allows
you to only read those portions that you need instead of the entire
dataset.

<ol class="step">
  <li>Right click the [ht::dataset NCEP Model Data ETA]
      data source in the [ht::command Data Sources]
      panel of the [ht::tab Field Selector]
      window and select the [ht::menu {Properties}] menu.</li>
  <li>Each [ht::dialog {Data Source Properties Dialog}] will 
      have one or more tabs for setting and viewing the properties
      of that data source.  Tab through the properties of this
      data source.</li>
  <li>Click the [ht::button Cancel] button to close the window</li>
</ol>

<div class="pagesubtitle">Data Choices (Fields)</div>

When a data source is loaded, a set of [ht::param data choices] 
are created from the metadata. This allows you to select
a subset of the dataset.

<ol class="step">

  <li>Select the [ht::dataset NCEP Model Data ETA]
      data source in the [ht::command Data Sources]
      panel of the [ht::tab Field Selector]
      window.</li>

  <li>In the [ht::command Fields] panel, you will
      see two tabs - [ht::param 3D grid] and 
      [ht::param 2D grid] indicating that this dataset has
      both 2D and 3D fields in it.</li>

  <li>Click on the little tab to the left of the 
      [ht::param 3D grid] field to expand that tab.
      The list contains those 3D fields from the dataset
      that the IDV can display.</li>

  <li>Select the [ht::param temperature] field.  When
      you select a field, the [ht::command Displays]
      and [ht::command Data Subset] panels are populated with
      entries applicable to that field.

</ol>

<p><b>Derived Choices</b><p>

When a data source creates the list of data choices from the parameters
in a dataset, it also uses a library of pre-defined derived quantities
to create a list of choices for fields that can be calculated from the
fields in the dataset.

<ul class="step">

  <li>Expand the [ht::param Derived] tab.</li>

  <li>In the expanded list, select [ht::param {Dewpoint (from T &amp; RH)}]. 
      This dataset does not have
      a dewpoint field in it, but it does have temperature (T) and
      relative humidity (RH) which can be used to calculate dewpoint.
  </li>

</ul>

<div class="pagesubtitle">Displays</div>

When each data choice is created, the metadata for that choice
is used to determine which displays are applicable to that field.

<ol class="step">

   <li>Look at the list of available display types for your
       Dewpoint selection in the [ht::command Displays]
       panel.</li>

   <li>Select the [ht::param {Flow Vectors (from GridRelative_u &amp; GridRelative_v)}]
       field and notice that the list of displays changes.</li>

   <li>Select the [ht::param {Sounding Data (T &amp; dewpoint only)}]
       field and notice that you get another list of displays.</li>

   <li>Select [ht::param {Dewpoint (from T &amp; RH)}]
       again.</li>

   <li>In the [ht::command Displays] panel, select
       [ht::display {Contour Plan View}] so we can
       create a horizontal slice of the data and display it as
       contours.</li>

</ol>

<div class="pagesubtitle">Data Subsetting</div>

The [ht::command Data Subset] panel allows you to temporally and
spatially subset the data you've chosen.   For this exercise, we
will look at subsetting by time and level.

<p><b>Times</b><p>

Each data choice may or may not have times associated with it
which are displayed in the [ht::command Times]
panel. If there is a set of times, you can select all or just a subset
of times to be displayed.  There are two ways you can select
a subset of times.

<ul class="step">

  <li>You can set the time subset for all parameters in the dataset.

    <ol class="substep">
      <li>Double click (or right click and select the 
          [ht::menu Properties] menu) on the dataset name in the 
          [ht::command Data Sources] panel to bring up the 
          [ht::dialog Data Source Properties] editor.</li>

      <li>This dataset has ten time steps. In the 
          [ht::tab Times] tab,
          uncheck the [ht::command Use Default]
          checkbox.  You can now select the subset of times.  Select
          the first five (5) times in the list
          ([ht::param 1998-06-29 12:00:00Z]
           to [ht::param 1998-06-30 12:00:00Z]). 
          [ht::listSelect]</li>

      <li>Click the [ht::button OK] button to apply
          this change and close the window.

      <li>Notice that the change is reflected in the 
          [ht::tab Times] tab of the [ht::command Data Subset] panel
          when you select [ht::param Dewpoint] this time.</li>

    </ol>
  </li>

  <li>You can set the time subset for a single parameter 
      in the [ht::tab Times] tab.

    <ol class="substep">

      <li>In the [ht::tab Times] tab of the [ht::command Data Subset]
          panel, uncheck the [ht::command Use Default]
          checkbox.
      <li>In the list of times in that panel, 
          select the last four (4) times in the list
          ([ht::param 1998-06-30 18:00:00Z] 
          to [ht::param 1998-07-01 12:00:00Z]).</li>
    </ol>
     
  </li>

</ul>

<p><b>Levels</b><p>

Each data choice may or may not have levels associated with it
which are displayed in the [ht::tab Level] tab of the
[ht::command Data Subset] panel.  If you do not select a
level, the first level is read in unless you are creating
a display that needs a volume of data.

<ul class="step">

  <li>You can set the level subset for a single parameter 
      in the [ht::tab Level] panel.

    <ol class="substep">

      <li>In the [ht::tab Level] tab, select the 
          [ht::param {850 hectopascal}] level.
    </ol>
     
  </li>

</ul>

When you are finished making all your selections, click the
<code class="button">Create Display</code> button to apply them
and create the display.  The subset of data you selected will
be read from the data source and displayed in the currently active
<code class="dialog">View Window</code>.
