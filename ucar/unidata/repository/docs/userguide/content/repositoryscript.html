The repository script entry allows an administrator to define arbitrary processing on the server via Jython (a Java implementation of Python).
The idea is that the administrator specifies to bits of Jython - an initialization and an execution. 

<h3>Initialization</h3>
The initialization code is used to create a form that a user will see. This form is created by calling methods on a FormInfo object (ucar.unidata.repository.type.JythonTypeHandler.FormInfo). For example,
here is the code from an <a href="http://motherlode.ucar.edu/repository/entry/form?entryid=a93d0675-c0ba-40ce-a161-5441266ff1d7">example on our RAMADDA server</a>.

The form is inside a 2 column html table. 
<p>

First, the FormInfo.setFormPrefix  method puts text before the table:
<pre>
formInfo.setFormPrefix("This is an example of the script facility in RAMADDA. ...");
</pre>


FormInfo.addFormLabel puts text inside the table in the second column:
<pre>
formInfo.addFormLabel("You can have the user select an entry");

</pre>

Now, there are different form input types that are added with 
FormInfo.addForm... calls. These methods take the form input name and a label.
Note: the input name will also be used as a Jython variable name when the form is uploaded.
<p>
FormInfo.addFormEntry allows the user to select some entry within RAMADDA. For example, you could
have the user select a data file that you will process in some way.
<pre>
formInfo.addFormEntry("entry1","Entry");
</pre>

FormInfo.addFormUpload allows the user to upload a file to RAMADDA.
<pre>
formInfo.addFormFileUpload("file","File");
</pre>

FormInfo.addFormText provides a text input or a text area.
It is of the form:

<pre>
FormInfo.addFormText(name,label, defaultValue, numberOfColumns,numberOfRows);
e.g.:
formInfo.addFormText("text1","Text","some default value",60,1);
formInfo.addFormText("text2","More text","some default value",60,5);
</pre>

You can also execute arbitrary Jython. Here we create an ArrayList, add some elements to it
and call FormInfo.addFormSelect to make a pull down menu.
<pre>
from java.util import ArrayList;
items = ArrayList();
items.add("Banana");
items.add("Apple");
items.add("Peach");
formInfo.addFormSelect("fruit", "Fruit", "", items);
</pre>


You can also just call FormInfo.append(String). To add anything else to the form. Note: since the form is in a table make sure your html you are appending is inside a html table row and column, e.g.:
<pre>
formInfo.append("&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;some html here&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;");
</pre>


<h3>Execution</h3>
When the form is uploaded by an end user RAMADDA sets a number of global variables based on the form input values. It then evaluates the execution code. 
<p>
There are always the variables:
<pre>
formInfo  
request - this is the RAMADDA Request object
typeHandler - the JythonTypeHandler
repository  - the Repository
</pre>

If you happen to add your own html input to the form you can always access the form arguments from the request object, e.g.:
<pre>
request.getString("input name", "default value");
</pre>


For the text and select inputs there will be Jython variables of the same name.
<p>
If the input was a file upload then the variable name will  be a string path to the file on the server.
<p>
If the input was a repository entry then the object the entry variable references is a ucar.unidata.repository.Entry object. If that entry is a file then there is also another variable set:
<pre>
  &lt;inputname&gt;_file
</pre>




The result can be one of three things. First, if you encounter an error in your execution call:
<pre>
formInfo.setErrorMessage("some error message");
</pre>

If you just want to return some html then do:
<pre>
formInfo.setResult("some html");
</pre>

If you want to return some file to the user (e.g., some processed data) then create an InputStream and call:
<pre>
formInfo.setInputStream(inputStream,"some mime type");
</pre>




Here is the execution code from the above example:
<pre>
result = "You entered&lt;br&gt;"+ "entry:" + entry1.getFullName() + "&lt;br&gt;" + "file:" + file+ "&lt;br&gt;";
result = result +  "text 1:" + text1+ "&lt;br&gt;"+ "fruit:" + fruit + "&lt;br&gt;"  + "text2:" + text2;
formInfo.setResult(result);
</pre>



<h3> Data Repository Script</h3>
The script type comes in two flavors. There is the regular one that just handles normal form inputs, etc. There is also one that will provide special access to entry data  files  using the Java/CDM and IntegratedDataViewer libraries.
For the most part this behaves the same way as described above. However, if there is a selected entry and if that entry is a file that can be opened via the Java/CDM stack (e.g., a gridded file), then a number of other variables will be created to allow the execution script  to access the data.
<p>
If the data file is a grid then a  ucar.nc2.dt.grid.GridDataset will be created and the variable &lt;name&gt;_griddataset will be set. Also, for grids, an instance of  the IDV's ucar.unidata.data.grid.GeoGridDataSource will be created as &lt;name&gt;_datasource.
If the file can be opened with Java/CDM but is not a grid then an ucar.nc2.dataset.NetcdfDataset will be created with name &lt;name&gt;_ncdataset.

<p>
What this allows you to do is get access to not only the direct netcdf data but also, in the case of grids, get access to the IDV's data access (and the underlying VisAD) and analysis capabilites. Anything you can do with gridded data in the IDV you can do on RAMADDA.
See the <a href="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/idv/docs/userguide/page_dataanalysis.html">IDV User guide</a> for more info.

<p>
Here is an <a href="http://motherlode.ucar.edu/repository/entry/show/RAMADDA/RAMADDA+Examples/Repository+Script/Script+example+2?entryid=fa8b4c6f-487b-410d-aea6-84616cc82bf2">example </a> of this from our RAMADDA server.
The initialization code specifies an entry and a file. The file is a map file and the result will be 
the min/max/average with the grid within each map polygon.
<pre>
formInfo.setFormPrefix("This is an example of the script facility in RAMADDA. ...");

formInfo.addFormEntry("grid","Grid Entry");
formInfo.addFormFileUpload("map","Map File");
</pre>

Here is the exection code. It defines a procedure applyMap and at the bottom calls the procedure passing in the arguments. Note the error handling up front if incorrect data is passed in.
<pre>
def applyMap(formInfo, grid_datasource, map):
   if(grid_datasource == None):
       formInfo.setErrorMessage("No grid data defined");
       return;
   #Read the map data. This can be a shapefile or IDV's xgrf format
   mapData = ShapeFileDataSource.readMap(map);
   if(mapData == None):
       formInfo.setErrorMessage("No map data defined");
       return;

   #Find the RH field
   data = grid_datasource.getData("RH");

   #call into the IDV java lib to get the minmaxaverage
   fieldStats = GridUtil.findMinMaxAverage(data,mapData);

   #make the result text
   result = "";
   for i in range(fieldStats.size()):
       fieldStat = fieldStats.get(i);
       result = result+str(fieldStat) +"\\n";

   #Set the result to be just the text so we don't decorate it as html
   formInfo.setMimeType("text/plain");
   formInfo.setResult(result);

#The input variable was grid so there should also be a grid_datasource
#map is the file that was uploaded by the user
applyMap(formInfo, grid_datasource,map);

</pre>


<h3>Jython libraries</h3>
You can import your own Jython libraries in a couple of ways. First,  file ending with ".py" in the RAMADDA plugins directory will be loaded into the interpreter. Second, you can add a Jython Attachment property to the entry or any of its parent folders (make the property inherited) and that will be loaded into the interpreter.
