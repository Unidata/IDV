To set the defaults for a data source bring up the 
Properties dialog by right clicking  (or double clicking)
on the data source name in the data sources panel
of the Field Selector window and select [ug::menu Properties]:

[ht::cimg images/DataSourceMenu.gif]

The Properties Dialog is different for different types of data sources. Here is 
the dialog window for a gridded data source:

[ht::cimg images/DataSourceProperties.gif]

Any displays that are showing data from a data source can be automatically
updated by selecting the [ug::button Reload Displays] button. When this is selected
all data will be reloaded and the displays will be updated when the user presses
[ug::button Apply] or [ug::button OK].

<subhead intoc="false" id="basicproperties">Basic Properties</subhead>
You can change the displayed name with the [ug::button Name] field.

<p>
Some data sources can automatically update themselves by selecting
the [ug::button Active] button. For example, if you had a set of most recent 
satellite images you can turn on Polling and have the data update to the latest
images every N minutes.
<p>
For point data you can define  <i>Time Binning</i> settings (not shown) by selecting
a Bin Size (e.g., 5 minutes, 1 hour) and a Round To value (e.g., On the hour, 15 minutes after the
hour). This will map all the observation times into the nearest bin.  The smallest time is rounded
with the Round To value (e.g., if Round To was &quot;10 after&quot; and the smallest time was
10:23 then this time would be rounded to 10:20). This is the base time. Each actual observation time
is mapped into a set of bins of Bin Size starting at the base time.


<subhead intoc="false" id="times">Times</subhead>
The Times tab allows you to select the times to use. The drop down menu has two menu items: [ug::button Use Default]
and [ug::button Use Selected]. Click the drop down menu, choose the [ug::button Use Selected]
menu item and select individual times. You can also right mouse click in the list
to show a popup menu that allows you to select different strides (e.g., every 3rd time).

[ht::cimg images/DataSourceTimes.gif]


A version of this time subsetting window is used in the Field
Selector. Here, you have additional menu items: [ug::button Match Time Driver] and [ug::button Set As TIme Driver]
to allow you to use the time driver times or to set the selected times as the time driver times.

<subhead intoc="false" id="spatialsubset">Spatial Subsetting</subhead>
For grids and other data source types  the data can be subset and decimated
with the [ug::button {Spatial Subset}] tab.
The [ug::menu {X Stride}], [ug::menu {Y Stride}] and [ug::menu {Z Stride}] menus
allow you to decimate a grid, selecting every Nth point.
The [ug::button Bounding Box] allows you to define a spatial area to load.
The default spatial domain of the data is shown by the blue outline box.
To select an area just drag on the map. Once a subset is selected it can be
resized (grab on the little black selection points) moved  (grab somewhere near the 
box) and delete (press the Delete key).
Specific lat/lon values can be entered in the fields on the left.  The [ug::button Match Display Area]
checkbox allows you to define a spatial subset option. By checking this option, the map area will
be disabled and this will be the default option for all the variables of this dataset.

[ht::cimg images/DataSourceSpatialSubset.gif]

A version of this spatial subsetting window is used in the Field
Selector. Here, you have drop down menu of items: [ug::button Use Default Region], [ug::button Select A Region] and
[ug::button Match Display Region]. These options allow you to use the default region, or to select a region, or to match the region
of the active view window's display area. The decimation and spatial subset are shown in different tabs:

[ht::cimg images/DataSourceSpatialSubsetField.gif]


The spatial subsetting window for the Satellite imagery also provides the preview of the dataset:

[ht::cimg images/DataSourceSateSpatialSubsetField.gif]

<p>
    The advanced tab for the the satellite imagery allows you to override the default properties the
    IDV uses to specify other aspects of the image data. The default values in the [ug::button Advanced]
    tab reflect what is showing in the [ug::button Region] tab. By default, all the text fields in this
    tab are disabled. To enable these text fields, you can select [ug::button Select A Region] in
    the [ug::button Region] tab, all the text fields except the [ug::button Magnification] will be editable.
    The information in the [ug::button Region] tab will be passed to the [ug::button Advanced] tab.
    Any changes in the [ug::button Advanced] tab will also be passed back to the [ug::button Region] tab.

<p>
    There are two different approaches to enable the [ug::button Magnification] widget. First, you can
    un-check the [ug::button Enable Adaptive Resolution] checkbox in the user preferences to enable
    the [ug::button Magnification] text field. Second, you can un-check the [ug::button Enable Adaptive Resolution]
    checkbox in the view window [ug::button Projections] drop down menu. In both cases, you need to reload the
    data to get the widget enable or disable if the data already loaded.

    [ht::cimg images/DataSourceSateAdvanced.gif]
<p>

    You can specify the placement point of the image (e.g., Center, Upper Left)
    and its  location. Location can either be specified as an Line/Element
    Area coordinate or as Latitude/Longitude.  Use the cycle buttons to select
    the type of location to use.

<p>
    The map button, <img src="choosers/images/MapIcon16.png"> will list the various center and corner locations
    of the different available map views. This allows you to choose a lat/lon position.

<p>
    Image size and magnification can also be set.  Click on the slider
    icon to change the values.

<p>
    The linked button (<img src="choosers/images/Linked.gif">), when selected, will automatically change the image size
    as the magnification is changed.

<p>
    The Full Resolution button <img src="choosers/images/arrow_out.png"> allows you to set the magnifcation,
    image size and position to be the full image resolution.

<subhead intoc="false" id="details">Details</subhead>
The Details tab shows further information about the data source, e.g.:
any documentation associated with the data, what files or urls are used, etc.


<subhead intoc="false" id="metadata">Metadata</subhead>
For grid data sources the Metadata tab shows the NetCDF metadata.
