<div class="overview">
Adding different displays to your WRF images. In this example, we add a color-shaded plan view to our contoured display.
</div>

<p>Now that we have basic control over our display, let's add another display to our image. The following example is based on the previous example, but has been re-arranged for clarity. Note that we have given each <code>DisplayControl</code> object (<code>dc_contour</code> and <code>dc_shade</code>) a "ZPosition" to ensure that the contours are on top of the color shaded display.</p>
