<P>

Jython  is  the Python computer language, implemented in Java. 
The Jython user sees regular Python and no Java. You do not need
to know Java to use Jython.
Python is a new language in which simple things are usually simple to do.
IDV formulas use syntax and methods from Jython.
 Jython (Python) has a simple syntax, but this is a powerful computer language
that can do most everything C++ and Java can do.

<p>

Jython has  an easy and intuitive syntax. 
Jython is as easy to write as FORTRAN, and easier than C or C++. 
If you have existing FORTRAN code, conversion should be 
straightforward, with line by line conversions in most cases.
In IDV formulas you can use any normal built-in Python (Jython)
operator, such as +, -, / *, and 
** for exponentiation, or numeric functions, such as abs, round, pow, or sqrt.
Jython is also used in defining your own methods, described 
in this section.

<p>

The IDV uses Jython for formulas for three reasons. One is that 
Jython can call Java code, so there can be full integration between
Jython methods and internal code in the IDV (you can see examples in the
IDV Jython system library). Another reason is that the IDV uses VisAD software
to store and manage data, and VisAD software is written in Java. 
VisAD also 
can be called directly by Jython. To work with data in the IDV you 
 use VisAD. And finally, because Jython is easy as most any computer language.

<p>

You do not need to study Jython/Python in detail to use VisAD formulas.
If you do wish to learn more about Jython and Python, we recommend these books

<div class="pagesubtitle">VisAD and the IDV</div>

The IDV also provides and supports 
[ht::popup "http://www.ssec.wisc.edu/~billh/visad.html" "VisAD"],
a Java library to provide display and analysis code for
multi-dimensional data. All data objects used by the IDV are actually,
invisibly to the user, stored in VisAD data objects, which carry with
them information about units, errors, navigation coordinate systems
and transformations, and other metadata.

<p>

VisAD includes a package of code,
visad.python.JPythonMethods,  to allow Jython calls to operate
on VisAD data objects, such as 3D grids. That is why in the IDV you
can write a simple formula such as (TC*1.8 + 32.0) - DewptF and it will
automatically apply the calculation to every element in two large 3D
grids referred to as TC and DewptF. 
No "do loops" over all grid points are needed;
and you don't even need to know anything about how the grid is 
defined, or the data format, or the the grids's navigation on the Earth.   
The same "IDV Formula" can be applied, without alteration,
to a single value, to data from a vertical sounding or a balloon
track, or  2D grids or other 3D grids. All you need is one line of code.
You can even mix data sources in one calculation: 
a temperature variable "TC" can come from Eta
forecasts and another "DewptF" from GFS, mapped differently on the globe.
All you need enter is a formula 
such as "(TC*1.8 + 32.0) - DewptF" and the rest is automatic.

<p>

You may use the IDV and its computation features without knowing
anything about VisAD. However, to do more, 
you will want to see the documents 
for visad.python.JPythonMethods in the 
[ht::popup "http://www.ssec.wisc.edu/~dglo/visad/" "VisAD API Documentation"].
In your web browser, in the upper left box in this page, scroll down
to visad.python and click on it. In the lower left box click on
JPythonMethods.
For complete information about VisAD, see the 
[ht::popup "http://www.ssec.wisc.edu/~billh/visad.html" "VisAD"] web site.
