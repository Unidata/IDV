You can capture the main 3D view as an image,
a QuickTime movie or an animated GIF.


<%childlist%>

[ht::subhead jpegcapture {Saving Images} {intoc="false"}]

You can save a display as an image. Select the 
[ug::menu View  Capture {Image...}] menu item.  
A file dialog will
popup where you can enter a file name for the image file. The IDV
supports JPEG, PNG and GIF formats.
From this File Dialog you can also specify the image quality (only 
used for JPEG's and what to capture.
<p>
Note: when capturing a image the screen cannot be obscured.
<p>
The IDV can also write out an image and the corresponding
Google Earth KML or KMZ file. For this to be correct the
projection must be a Lat/Lon geographic projection (i.e.,  rectilinear)
and in an overhead view.  The simplest way to get a correct projection
is to select the [ug::menu Projections {Use Displayed Area}]
menu item. If you specify a .kml file the IDV will generate
an image with the same file prefix and the kml file that refers
to the image. If you specify a .kmz file the IDV this file
(which is a zip format) will contain the image and the kml file.


[ht::subhead printcapture {Print Current View} {intoc="false"}]

You can send any display to a printer. Select the
[ug::menu View  Capture {Print...}] menu item.
A <b>Print</b> dialog will popup where you can configure and print an image.

[ht::subhead moviecapture {Save QuickTime Movies} {intoc="false"}]

You can save any sequence of displays as a QuickTime movie. 
Select the [ug::menu View  Capture {QuickTime Movie...}] menu item
to bring up  the &quot;Image capture&quot;  window:

[ht::cimg images/VMImageCapturePopup.gif]

To make a QuickTime movie or animated GIF
there are three steps: capturing the frames, previewing the
frames, and creating the movie.

<p>


To capture frames, in the <b>Capture</b> section of the "Image capture"  window, do one of the following three choices:
<ul>
<li>click on the <b>Capture one image</b> button to make a single frame of the current
IDV display. Then you change the display to exactly what you want
in the next frame, capture that new image, and continue through the movie.

<li> Click  on <b>Capture animation</b> to automatically capture all frames in a 
display time sequence which you can animate with the usual IDV 
<a href="../ui/Animation.html">Time Animation
Controls</a>. Check <b>Reset to start time</b> to ensure that you 
capture the entire animation sequence. The
QuickTime animation capture starts on the first frame visible in the
IDV and goes to the end. So you can use this to capture part of a sequence.


<li> Click on <b>Capture automatically</b>
to start taking snapshots of frames from the IDV
display while you make changes, such as while you change the viewpoint
by zooming, rotation, and panning, and combinations
of all three.
To stop the automatic snapshots, click on the button again (which now says Stop). 
You can set the automatic snapshot sampling rate with the 
[ug::button  Rate] field.
</ul>

You can combine these different methods of capture. The list of frames is additive.

<p>

If you want to save the individual intermediate files that are used to
create the movie, select [ug::button Save Files To] button and specify a
directory and file name format. Otherwise, the intermediate files will
be saved in a temporary directory and will be removed.
<p>
You can use the following templates to customize the name of the
output file:
<ul>
<li><b>%count%</b> is the image counter
<li><b>%count:decimal format%</b> allows you to format the count using
the same rules defined in the  lat/lon format section of the
<a href="../tools/Preferences.html">User Preferences</a>. (or
Google 'java decimalformat' for more information).
<li><b>%time%</b> is the  animation time in the default format
<li><b>%time:time format%</b> a template that begins with 
"time:" and contains a time format string using the 
the same date formatting rules described in the
<a href="../tools/Preferences.html">User Preferences</a>.

<p>

You can [ug::button Preview] the movie and remove individual frames 
or [ug::button Delete All] the frames. 
<p>


When done capturing frames select the [ug::button Save movie] button
to specify the Quicktime movie file (.mov) or the animated GIF file (.gif). 


[ht::subhead  movieplayback {Play QuickTime Movies} {intoc="false"}]

The IDV supports displaying certain types of Quicktime movies (including
the ones the IDV generates). Just load in the Quicktime movie from
the File Data Chooser.
