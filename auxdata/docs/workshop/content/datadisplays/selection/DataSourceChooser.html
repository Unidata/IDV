<div class="overview">
The Data Source Chooser is used to load data sets into the IDV.
</div>

<h3>Data Source Chooser Window</h3>

The Data Source Chooser has tabs for selecting the different 
<a href="[ht::ug::url /data/DataSources.html]">types</a>
of data that the IDV can display.  Let's examine the features of
this pane.


<ol class="step">

  <li>[ht::startIDV]</li>

  <li>[ht::openDataSourceChooser]</li>
  
  <li>There is a tab for loading in each of the types of data that
      the IDV supports.  Click through each of the tabs to 
      see what is there.  We will examine each tab in more 
      detail in the subsequent exercises.</li>
<!--
  <li>For the purposes of this section, we will load in a 
      netCDF file of Eta model data from disk.  
      Click on the [ht::command Files] tab.</li>

  <li>Use the <code class="chooser">File selector</code> chooser 
      to navigate to the <code class="filename"><%workshop.datadir%>/grids</code>
      directory.  
      
[ht::cimg images/DataSourceChooser.gif]

  <li>Select the <code class="filename">sample_eta_grid.nc</code>
      file and click the <code class="button">Add Source</code> button.</li>

  <li>At this point, the IDV reads in enough metadata from the 
      data source to populate the fields in the 
      [ht::command Field Selector].</li>

  <li>Now, we'll look at the [ht::command Field Selector].
