]

The IDV makes use of the 
[dg::class ucar.unidata.util.ResourceCollection]
and
[dg::class ucar.unidata.xml.XmlResourceCollection] classes
to hold different collections of resources.
These resources are defined in the <a href=property.html>property file</a>.
The default IDV resources are kept in the package 
[dg::package ucar.unidata.idv.resources].
The <a href=../example.properties>example properties file</a> has documentation
about how to define new paths to resources. 
<p>
In the properties file is a set of properties:<pre>
application.resource.paramgroups=%IDVPATH%/paramgroups.xml;%SITEPATH%/paramgroups.xml;
application.resource.derived=%USERPATH%/derived.xml;%IDVPATH%/derived.xml
</pre>
made up a of list of semi-color separated paths. These paths can refer
to the local file system, to internal java resources or they can be urls.


<p>
Many of these resource files can be edited by the end user through the
IDV, including colortables, parameter defaults, data aliases, derived data,
Python libraries and users choosers.
For these resources the first resource specified in 
the properties 
file is the one that is editable. For example, 
from [dg::class ucar/unidata/idv/resources/idv.properties],
is the line:<pre>
application.resource.colortables=%USERPATH%/colortables.xml;%IDVPATH%/colortables.xml
</pre>

The first resource, %USERPATH%/colortables.xml,
is where user created and edited color tables get stored.
The macro %USERPATH% is replaced with the path to the idv preference
directory:<br>
<code> userhomedirectory/.metapps&lt;application class name&gt;</code><br>
which is where all user created or modified data is stored.

<p>
If you want to release an application with some new or altered resource
files you can simply bring up the IDV, edit the given resource (e.g., through the Edit
menu). Then simply look in your .metapps directory for the relevant file and copy that
into your application area (or on a web server).
<p>



[resource {Data source specifications} application.resource.datasource  datasource.xml]
The Data source specification resources  define the set of DataSource classes
available and what kinds of files and/or urls they can handle. 
See  <a href=datasource.html>datasource.html</a> for more information.

[resource {Display controls} application.resource.controls controls.xml]
This resource defines the different displays available with the IDV
and what kinds of data they are applicable to.
See  <a href=displays.html>displays.html</a> for more information.

[resource {Data aliases} application.resource.aliases aliases.xml]
The data aliases file allows you to define a mapping between
field names in the data sources you use to canonical field names 
that the IDV can understand. The aliases.xml looks like:
[pre {
<aliases>
 <alias name="the canonical name"     label="Temperature"   
     aliases="comma separated list of aliases" />
<!-- e.g.: -->
 <alias name="TEMP"     
        label="Temperature"   
        aliases="T,t,Temperature,tdry" />
</aliases>}]

Note: the canonical names are not a fixed set. You can define your own
and they can be used in other resource files.


[resource {Parameter groups} application.resource.paramgroups paramgroups.xml]
The paramgroups.xml resources allow you to define groups of parameter names.
This is used in the Derived data creation (described below). 
The format is:
[pre {
<paramgroups&gt;
  <paramgroup  name="some group"&gt;
    <params p1="param 1"  p2="param 2" ... pn="..." /&gt;      
<!-- e.g.: --&gt;
    <params p1="eU" p2="eV" label="El nino winds" /&gt;
   </paramgroup&gt;
  <paramgroup  name="u_and_v"&gt;
      ...
   </paramgroup&gt;
</paramgroups&gt;
}]

Currently,  parameter groups cannot be created or changed through the IDV gui.


[resource {Parameter defaults} application.resource.paramdefaults paramdefaults.xml]
There are a variety of display conventions that can be used when showing
data, e.g., contouring information, value ranges, units, color tables, etc.
These can be defined in the paramsefaults.xml resource file.
The format is:
[pre {<params>    
    <param name="^li$"  
        table="DbZ"  range_min="-15.0"  range_max="15.0" 
	ci_min="..." ci_max=".." ci_interval="-2" ci_base="0"
        ci_dash="true|false" ci_label="true|false"/>
</params>    
}]

Where the ci_... are the contouring information, range_... is the min and max range
values to be used, table="..." is the name ofthe color table.
Changing this file is best done through the IDV Gui (Edit menu).
Note the name can contain regular expression patters.


[resource {Derived data} application.resource.derived derived.xml]
These resources are used  to define end-user formulas and
default derived quantities. This is a pretty complicated piece of the
IDV and is described more fully in <a href=derived.html>derived.html</a>


[resource {Color tables} application.resource.colortables colortables.xml]
The XML that this resource points to is not a custom XML format, rather
it is the result of persisting (using 
the <a href=persistence.html>XmlEncoder</a>
persistence mechanism) a list of [dg::class ucar.unidata.util.ColorTable] objects
that have been created with the color table editor (See the Edit-&gt;Color tables menu).

[resource {Projections} application.resource.projections projections.xml]
The projections.xml file is like the colortables.xml in that it too
is the result of XmlEncoder persitence. To change projections or create new ones
go to the View menu and choose Projections. Edit the list of projections.
A new projections.xml file will be saved in your .metapps directory.




[resource {Default bundles} application.resource.bundles default.xidv]
This list of resources  points to where default bundles (those that are 
automatically loaded by the IDV) are kept.

[resource {Data choosers} application.resource.choosers choosers.xml]
The choosers.xml file allows you to define what kinds of data choosers
show up in the data chooser window. See <a href=choosers.html> for more detail</a>.


[resource {User choosers} application.resource.userchooser userchooser.xml]
This is probably going to become obsolescent in the future but the userchooser.xml
holds the user created data chooser entries (See the "New pane" button on the data chooser
window)


[resource {Python libraries} application.resource.jython default.py]
The Python library is used to initialize the Jython interpreter.


[resource {Menu bar} application.resource.menubar defaultmenu.xml]
The menu bar used within the IDV is defined via xml. The xml contains 
<i>menus</i> and  <i>menuitem</i> nested tags and directly map to
the menu hierarchy:
[pre {<menus label="Commands">
    <menu label="File" id="file">
       <menu label="New">
           <menuitem label="Display window" 
                     action="jython:idv.createNewWindow ();" />
           <menuitem label="Data source panel" 
                     action="jython:idv.createDataTreeWindow();" />
       </menu>
   </menu>
</menus>
}]
For menu items there is a (String) action which gets passed to the 
[method IntegratedDataViewer.handleAction] method. If the action starts with
"jython:" the rest of the string is executed by the  Jython interpreter (For security
only methods calls of the form: idv.method(...) are allowed).
If the action starts with "help:" the Java help application is launched.
If the action is a bundle file (.xidv) and an embedded bundle jnlp file (.jnlp)
the bundle is loaded. If the action can be handled by a DataSource then the DataSource
is loaded.


[resource {Help tips} application.resource.helptips helptips.xml]
The initial help tips dialog is driven by the helptips.xml resource.

[resource {Station locations} application.resource.locations nexradstns.xml]
Holds the default nexrad stations.
