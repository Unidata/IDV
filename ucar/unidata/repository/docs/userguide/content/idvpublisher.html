[ht::head {IDV Publisher}]
<%nochildlist%>


The <a href="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/idv">Integrated Data Viewer (IDV)</a>
has the ability to publish IDV bundles and generated products directly
to a RAMADDA data server. This facility is 
defined in an IDV <i>plugin</i>. To load it you need to bring up the
Plugin Manager from the [ht::menu Tools {Plugin Manager}] menu.
Under <i>Miscellaneous</i> install the &quot;RAMADDA Publisher&quot;
plugin and restart the IDV.

This plugin provides the ability to create new accounts on different RAMADDA servers. It also comes with a pre-defined anonymous account that allows you to publish content to the Contributions area on our 
<a href="http://motherlode.ucar.edu/repository/entry/show/Top/IDV+Resources/Contributions?entryid=bfc82cf9-8548-4393-af10-20ec2274ceb9">motherlode server</a>.

<p>
If you have your own account on a RAMADDA server you can create an IDV publisher. If you have successfully installed the RAMADDA Publisher plugin there should be
a &quot;Publisher&quot; menu in the [ht::menu File] menu. 
Choose
[ht::menu File Publisher New] to bring up the RAMADDA Publisher configuration dialog:
[ht::cimg images/idvpublishernew.gif]

You can optionally change the name. You need to provide the server name (e.g., motherlode.ucar.edu), 
the port the server is running on,
the base path of the repository (&quot;/repository&quot; is the default),
and your user id and password.  Note: the password is saved on your local 
disk (in your IDV directory) similarly to how browsers and other clients
save  and manage your passwords.
<p>
You can leave the User Id and Password fields blank to create an anonymous account. Different groups on
a RAMADDA server can be configured to support anonymous upload. You or others won't be able to view any anonymously
uploaded content until the group administrator OK's the publication of the content.
<p>
Pressing OK will create a new Publisher configuration and attempt to
connect to the server. You can change this configuration through the
[ht::menu File Publish Configure] menu. You can remove a publisher
through the [ht::menu File Publish Delete] menu.

Once you have created one or more publisher accounts whenever you 
save a bundle, a captured image or a movie there will be a 
&quot;Select Publisher&quot; menu shown in the File Dialog:
[ht::cimg images/idvpublisherfile.gif]

Enter the file name you want save and also select the Publisher account
you want to use from the &quot;Select Publisher&quot; menu.
The IDV will save the bundle or product file as usual but then
it will also popup the publish dialog:
[ht::cimg images/idvpublisher.gif]

This allows you to enter a name and description for the entry that will be created on the RAMADDA server. You can optionally enter any  number of &quot;tags&quot; (comma separated) in the Tags field.
<p>
You need to select the RAMADDA group to where your new entry will be placed.
This tree view will indicate what groups you have write access to. The <b>bold</b> groups
are those you have write permission for. The <i>italics</i> groups are those  that you can
anonymously upload to.
Select the group.  Note: by right clicking on a group you can bring up a context menu
that allows you to create a new group or to refresh the group tree view.
<p>
The date range and lat/lon bounding box are taken from the date range and lat/lon extent of the the displays you have loaded. You can change these values
and/or clear out the lat/lon values.
<p>
Pressing OK will publish the bundle or product to RAMADDA and a confirmation
dialog will be shown.

<p>
If you have data loaded in the IDV (e.g., OpenDAP grids)
whose source is the  RAMADDA server that you are publishing to
you can optionally choose to create a RAMADDA &quot;association&quot;
between the content your are publishing and the data entry in RAMADDA.
<p>

When you save a &quot;.zidv&quot; bundle (i.e., one that contains data)
the publisher dialog will show a checkbox that allows you to upload the
data files that the zidv bundle contains as separate entries to RAMADDA.
You can also choose to upload the .zidv bundle as well.

<subhead intoc="false" id="products">Publishing Products</subhead>

When you capture an image or a movie product the File Save dialog will
also have a &quot;Select Publisher&quot; menu. When publishing a product
you can choose to publish the product directly or you can choose to
publish a bundle and attach the product to the bundle. For example,
if you do a screen capture in the IDV and publish it you can
publish the bundle file and attach the screen capture as an attachment
and have it shown as a thumbnail image in RAMADDA.
