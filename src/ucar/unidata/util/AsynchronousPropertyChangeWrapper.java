/**
 * Provides support for the asynchronous handling of property-change events.
 * Property-change events are placed in a one-element event-queue for later,
 * asynchronous processing by a wrapped {@link PropertyChangeListener}.  If
 * more than one event is received while the asynchronous, wrapped {@link
 * PropertyChangeListener} is processing an event, then all events but the last
 * are discarded.  This implementation is good for {@link PropertyChangeEvent}s
 * that are self-contained and completely independent of one another.
