A Display Control is the interface through which a display can be managed.
A display is usually shown in a view though they can be stand-alone.


<subhead id="legends">Display Legends</subhead>

The legend in a View lists the set of Display Controls within that view. 
In the image below, the  legend has been floated from the main view window into its
own window. This is done with the [ug::button Float Window] button.

[ht::cimg images/SideLegend.gif {Side Legend}]

<p>
The  legend  shows each display under the 
&quot;display  category&quot; of that
display. For example,  the legend in the above image  shows the categories
&quot;Maps&quot;, &quot;General&quot;, &quot;Imagery&quot;, 
&quot;Plan Views&quot;  and &quot;Point Data&quot;. 
The display category may be changed (see below). This is useful
for grouping and controlling the visibility of a group of displays.

<p>

The legend label shows the parameter or field name, the display type,
and sometimes other information such as the level of a plan view or
value of an isosurface. The label may be changed by a user using items
under the [ug::menu Edit {Properties}] menu item (described below).
Clicking on the highlighted part of the label will bring up the displays
control window. Right clicking will bring up the displays control menu.





<p>
The category display within the legend can be toggled to show or
hide the displays under that category with the 
[ug::button Toggle Category] button. The details of a 
display can also be toggled with the
[ug::button Toggle Details] button. The visibility of the displays under
a category (i.e., the graphical display within the main view window)
can be changed with the [ug::button Category Visibility Checkbox]. The
visibility of an individual display can be changed with the 
[ug::button Display Visibility Checkbox]

<p>
The [ug::button Remove] button allows you to quickly remove a display.
The [ug::button Lock Visibility Toggle] allows you to &quot;lock&quot;
the current visibility of the display and not change it while doing the
<a href="#visibility">visibility cycling</a>.

<p>
Detailed information about a display may also be shown in the legend.
For example, for those displays that use a color table, the color
bar will also be shown in the legend. Moving the mouse over the color bar
shows intermediate values. Click on the color bar to get a <a
href="../tools/ColorTableEditor.html">Color Table Editor</a> with the
color table for that display.



<subhead id="dnd">Drag And Drop</subhead>

By clicking and dragging on this legend label you can drop it into 
another View to change which View the display control is in. Also, 
within the Dashboard's Displays tab, you can use drag and drop button 
<img src="images/dnd.gif"> to drop it onto one of the View labels
to also change the View. Within the legend you can also drag label 
onto another Category label to change the display category. 


<subhead id="menus">Menus</subhead>
All display control windows share a common set of
<b>File, Edit, View</b>, and <b>Help</B> menu items, 
shown in the menu bar. Different controls may also
have custom items in these menus as well.
<p>

The [ug::menu File] menu has these common choices:

<ul>
[ug::menuDesc {Remove Display} { Remove the display.}]


[ug::menuDesc {Save} { A variety of ways of saving the state of the display.}]


<ul>
[ug::menuDesc {Save Data in Cache} {This allows you to save the current
data of the display in a Cache Data Source as a new Field. 
You will be prompted for the name of the field. You can use this
in a variety of ways:
<ul> 
<li> After calculating a complex formula, selecting operands for the formula,
etc.,  to create the data in a display you can save off the formula and 
the data that was calculated. Then you can create new displays from that
formula without having  to reselect the operands and recalculate the
final data.
<li> In a Web Map Server (WMS) display this allows you to capture the image
and then make use of it in formulas and in other displays. For example,
you can drape the image over topography.
</ul>
}]



[ug::menuDesc {Save As Parameter Defaults} { 
Allows you to save the current display state for the 
parameter as the default for that parameter in the future.
See the <a href="../tools/ParameterDefaultsEditor.html">
Parameter Defaults Editor</a> page for more information.
}]


[ug::menuDesc {Save Display as Favorite} { 
Allows you to save the current display state (without the data)
as a Favorite Display.
}]

[ug::menuDesc {Save Display as Bundle } {

Start <a href="../Bundles.html#jnlp">JNLP</a> file.
}]



</ul>

[ug::menuDesc {Reload Data} {Reload the data for this display.}]

[ug::menuDesc {Close Window} { If the Display Control is shown in its own window
this is used to close the control window.  It normally doesn't remove the control (unless a preference has been set).}]

</ul>

The [ug::menu Edit] menu has these common choices:

<ul>

[ug::menuDesc {Color Table} { For displays that have a color table this
menu allows you to edit the color table, change the range, choose a new
color table, etc.
}]

[ug::menuDesc {Selector Color, et. al.} {
Some displays (e.g., data probe) use a  single color in the display (e.g.,
for showing the selector point or line). Use this menu to set the color.
}]

[ug::menuDesc {Change Parameter} { Some displays allow you to change the
data parameter that is being used.
}]

[ug::menuDesc {Change Display Unit} {Some displays allow you to change
the unit that is used in the display, e.g., changing temperature plots
in Kelvin to Celsius.
}]


[ug::menuDesc {Change Contours} {Displays with contours allow you to change
the unit that is used in the display.
}]


[ug::menuDesc {Sharing} {This sub-menu allows you
to turn on/off sharing and to set the &quot;share group&quot;. 
When sharing is turned on certain state is shared among displays of the 
same type that are in the same share group.  The share group can be
an arbitrary name.
<p>
For example, the location of a vertical cross section, the color table,
location of a probe point, etc., can all be shared.
}]



[ug::menuDesc {Properties} {The <a href="#properties">Properties</a>
dialog allows you to change
the display label, the display category, the id and the color scale
properties for this display.
}]






</ul>
<a name="DisplayControlViewMenu">

<ul>
[ug::menuDesc {Visible} { check box allows you to toggle visibility.
}]

[ug::menuDesc {Lock Visibility} { Check box allows you to toggle the
visibility lock (see <a href="#visibility">visibility cycling</a> below).
}]

[ug::menuDesc {Bring to Front} { If this display is showing at the same level

</ul>


<subhead id="properties">Properties Dialog</subhead>
The Properties dialog is brought up with the
[ug::menu Edit Properties] menu:

[ht::cimg images/ControlProperties.gif {Display Control Properties}]

The [ug::button {Display Category}] field is arbitrary text and is 
used to organize
the legend.  The &quot;&lt;&lt;&quot; button shows a list of all of the
current display categories and allows you to easily set this field.

<p>
The [ug::button Legend Label] field is the label used in the legend of
this display control. It can contain arbitrary text as well
as a set of &quot;macros&quot;. The macros can be added
to the label with the [ug::menu {Add Macro}] button:
<ul>
<li> [ug::menu {Short Name}] This is the short name of the parameter being displayed.
<li> [ug::menu {Long Name}] This is the long name of the parameter being displayed.
<li> [ug::menu {Data Source Name}] This is the  name of the data source that produced
the parameter being displayed.

<li> [ug::menu {Display Name}] The name of the display.
<li> [ug::menu {Timestamp}] The time of the data that is currently being displayed using the default time format preference.
You can also use a macro of the form %time:&lt;time pattern&gt;% to
set a specific time format other than the default.  &lt;time pattern&gt;
follows the same rules defined in the 
<a href="../tools/Preferences.html">User Preferences</a> section.  For example,
%time:HHz&nbsp;EEE&nbsp;dd&nbsp;MMM&nbsp;yyyy% would give something like
<b>12GMT&nbsp;Fri&nbsp;16&nbsp;Feb&nbsp;2007</b>.
<li> [ug::menu {...}] And other values depending on the display.

</ul>
<p>

The [ug::button {Extra Legend Labels}] field acts like the Legend Label field (e.g., with macros).
<p>

The [ug::button {Display Label}] field acts like the Legend Label field
to define the text label that is shown in the display list. The color swatch
shows the current color for the labeld.  Clicking on it brings up a color 
menu that can be used to change the color of the label.

<p>
The [ug::button Id] field is used to define an ID for this display. The ID is
used for accessing particular displays from the <a href="../isl/index.html">
IDV Scripting Language</a>.

<p>
There may be a variety of check boxes:
<ul>
<li> [ug::button Show In Display List]
Allows you to toggle the visibility of the label in the view window.
Note that you must enable showing the list of display labels
that are toggled on using the [ug::menu View Properties] dialog
of the view window, or by setting the global property for
all display through the <a href="../tools/Preferences.html">User
Preferences</a> dialog.

<li> [ug::button Lock Visibility Toggle] Locks/unlocks 
<a href="#visibility">visibility toggling</a>.


<li> [ug::button Show Note Text] 
Arbitrary text notes can be added to a
display. This checkbox menu item shows or hides the text field 
that allows you to edit the notes.



<li> [ug::button {Use Fast Rendering}] 
When this is checked on, the IDV will
not try to account for projection seams.  This will cause displays to
be rendered faster at the expense of accuracy.


</ul>



<p>

There may be other tabs shown, depending on the display. For example,
the [ht::command Color Scale] tab allows you to configure where the color scale
bar is shown (see below). The [ht::command Spatial Subset] tab allows 
you to change the spatial subsetting of the data.

<subhead id="colorsacle">Color Scale</subhead>

For those controls that include color tables, you can display the color 
scale (legend) in the main view window.  Use the options under the
[ht::command Color Scale] tab to configure the positioning and labelling
of the color scale.

[ht::cimg images/ColorScale.gif {Color Scale Properties}]

<subhead id="visibility">Display Visibility</subhead>

<ul>
  <li>In the  legend the 
      [ht::command {Display Visibility}] checkbox to the left
      of the label can be used to toggle the visibility of that display.
      <p>


  <li>The function keys <code class="command">F1, F2, F3</code><b>*</b> can
      be used to cycle visibility as follows:

      <ul>

        <li>The [ht::command {F1}] key cycles visibility through 
            all non-locked displays, showing one at a time.</li>

        <li>The [ht::command {F2}] turns on all non-locked 
            displays.</li>

        <li>The [ht::command {F3}] turns off all non-locked 
            displays.</li>

      </ul>
      <b>*</b><i>On a Mac laptop, you may need to press the "Fn" key along
      with the particular function key</i>.

   </li>

  <li>The padlock icon <img src="images/lock.png"> on the right
  side of the [ht::command {Legend}] is used to block the effects of
  the visibility toggling described above. When locked the visibility of
  a display is not affected by the toggling.

   <li>Use the [ug::menu View Visible] checkbox
       menu item in each display control's menu.</li>

</ul>
