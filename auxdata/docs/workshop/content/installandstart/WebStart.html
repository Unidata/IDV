<a href="https://java.sun.com/products/javawebstart/"> Java Web Start</a>
is an application-deployment technology from Sun Microsystems that downloads
all necessary software for an application and then starts the application
with a single click in your Web browser.

<p>

One advantage of Web Start is that it will install the program
on the first download and will automatically check
for updates and retrieve new versions on subsequent start-ups. 
Web Start has the disadvantage that you have to first install
Java (which includes the Web Start distribution).

<p>

<ol class="step">

  <li>For this workshop, you can launch the workshop 
     version of the IDV through Web Start from:
<p>
<ul>
<a href="<%idv.website%>/webstart/IDV/workshopIdv.jnlp">
<b><%idv.website%>/webstart/IDV/workshopIdv.jnlp</b>
</a>
</ul>
  <p>
  The Java Network Launching Protocol (JNLP) file at that location 
  specifies the location for the files to download.  It also includes
  the <code class="command">installplugin</code> specification that we used
  earlier.
  </li>

  <li>After downloading the files, the IDV is automatically launched.
      You will be asked to accept a certificate of authenticity.
      Accept this and the IDV will start up.</li>

  <li>Notice that this IDV looks the same as the one you started from
      the command line.  In fact, it uses the same preferences that
      were used by the command line version, so starting either way
      should give the same results.</li>

  <li>This was just a demonstration, so you can exit the IDV in preparation
      for the next section.  For the rest of the workshop, we'll use
      the command line version.</li>
</ol>
