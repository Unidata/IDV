Sharing is a mechanism to share control operations between two or
more displays. For example, you can have one 
<a href="../ui/Animation.html">animation control</a>
control animation in two windows at once.

<p>

For <b>sharing animation</b> in two windows, such as in the
main IDV view window and a vertical cross section control,
open the animation properties dialog in each animation control
by clicking on the <font color="blue" size="+1"><b>i</b></font> icon. 
Toggle on the <b>Shared</b> box and click on <b>Ok</b>. 
Then using either animation
control will effect animation in both windows.

<p>
You can share other kinds of display controls, such as sharing one
selector line in vertical cross sections. This is toggled on by clicking on
the <b>Share</b> check box under the [ug::menu View] menu in the 
control window.
