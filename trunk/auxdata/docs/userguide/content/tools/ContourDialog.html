The <b>Contour Properties Editor</b> is invoked from any 
contour display control with the <b>Contour: Set</b> button.

Use the items in this window to set contouring properties.

<p><B>Contour Interval</B> determines the spacing 
(difference in value) between contours.   Set it to a single
value to specify a regular interval between contours.  You can 
specify irregular contour intervals with a semi-colon separated
list of the values. For example:
<pre>
       <b>5400;5460;5800</b>
</pre>
would only show the 5400, 5460 and 5800 contour lines.  
<p>
You can also specify different contour intervals for different ranges
with the following syntax:
<pre>
     cint1/min1/max1;cint2/min1/max2;....;cintn/minn/maxn
</pre>
For example, for geopotential heights:<p>
<pre>
     <b>30/0/4200;60/4200/8600;120/8600/24000</b>
</pre>
would draw contours at 30 gpm between 0 and 4200, 60 gpm between
4200 and 8600 and 120 gpm between 8600 and 24000.
<p>
To show a single contour line, specify the contour interval, min
and max as the same value.
For example:
<pre>
    <b>5400/5400/5400</b> 
</pre>
would only show the 5400 line.

<p><B>Base contour</B>  
is the value on which all contours are based. All contours will be
integer multiples of the contour interval from the base value. For
example, with a base value of 0 and a contour interval of 3 contours
would be created at ..-6, -3, 0, 3, 6... A base of 1 with that interval
would create contours at ..-5, -2, 1, 4, 7... The base value need not
be the lowest contour level on a plot, or inside the range of values
plotted; it is only a computational reference point. The base contour
value is also used for controlling which lines are dashed.

<p>

<B>Minimum value</B> is a limit 
below which no contour lines are shown. The minimum may be larger than
the base value, so that the base value may never appear on a plot.

<p><B>Maximum value</B>
is an upper limit above which no contour lines are shown. The minimum
and maximum values need not match contour line values; they are only
limits.

<p><B>Line width</B>
sets the line width (in pixels) of the contour lines and labels.

<p>

You can toggle the labels by clicking the <B>Labels</B> check box.

<p>

If <B>Dash</B> is checked, values less than the base value are dashed.
If base is set higher than maximum value, then all lines are dashed.

<p>

Click on <B>OK</B> to set the values you want and close this window. 
Click <b>Apply</b> to set the values but leave this window open.
