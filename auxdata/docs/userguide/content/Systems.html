The IDV should run on any platform that fully supports <b>Java
6</b> and <b>Java 3D</b> and has been tested by Unidata on <b>Windows, Linux,
Solaris (SPARC and x86), Mac OS-X</b>.

<p> For reasonable performance, it is recommended that an Intel system
running IDV have at least a <b>1.2 GHz processor and 1 GB memory
(RAM)</b>. Performance will be even better with faster processors and
more memory. Detailed requirements are listed below.</p>

<%childlist%>

<subhead id="os" intoc="false">Operating Systems and Java Versions</subhead>

The IDV runs on any platform that supports:
<ul>
<li><b>Java</b> version 1.6 or higher<b>AND</b>
<li><b>Java 3D</b> version 1.3.1 or later (1.5.2 recommended for performance).
</ul>
<p>

The IDV is known to run on the following operating systems:<p>

<table border="1">
<tr><th>OS</th><th>Version</th></tr>
<tr><td><b>Windows</b></td><td>XP, Vista, 7 (32 or 64 bit)<sup><b>(1)</b></sup></td></tr>
<tr><td><b>Linux</b></td><td> Fedora Core 9, 10, 11<sup><b>(2)</b></sup></td></tr>
<tr><td><b>Mac OS-X</b></td><td>10.5 or later<sup><b>(3)</b></sup></td></tr>
<tr><td><b>Solaris/SPARC</b></td><td>Solaris 9+<sup><b>(4)</b></sup></td></tr>
<tr><td><b>Solaris/x86</b></td><td>Solaris 10 (Intel)<sup><b><b>(5)</b></sup></td></tr>
</table>
<p>
  
If other platforms fully support Java (version 1.6+) and 
Java 3D (version 1.3.1 or higher) (e.g. AIX, IRIX) , they should 
also work.

<p>

Your graphics system must support 3D; make sure you have the latest
video driver for your graphics card. On Linux, the driver must support 
GLX, an X windows system extension to OpenGL programs.

<p>
<b>NOTES:</b>
<p>

<b><sup>(1)</sup></b>You must have 
Direct-X version 9.0 or higher installed on your Windows system if 
you use the Direct-X version of Java 3D.
<br>

<b><sup>(2)</sup></b>The version of the OpenGL library must support
GLX 1.3.</a>.

<br>

<b><sup>(3)</sup></b>Java 6 must be installed for the IDV to run on Mac OS-X.
For those IDV users running on Mac OS-X 10.5, you can upgrade your Java version either by installing Snow Leopard, or by installing the Java update avaiable 
<a href="http://www.apple.com/downloads/macosx/apple/application_updates/javaformacosx105update1.html">here</a>.
<p>
Please note that Java 6 is only available for Intel based Macs and 
that the update above only works on 64 bit systems. If you have a 32-bit 
Intel based Mac, you can get Java 6 by upgrading to Snow Leopard.
<p>
If you install Java from the update, you'll need to make it your default Java:
<p>
To find and/or update your default Java version, follow these steps:
<ol>

<li> Open the "Java Preferences" application located in /Applications/Utilities

<li> Look for "Java SE 6" in the "Java Applications" section

<li> The version at the top of the "Java Applications" list is the version being used by IDV. If "Java SE 6" is not at the top of the list, click and drag it to the top of the list (using the 64-bit option, if available), and you are ready to run IDV. If "Java SE 6" is not in the "Java Applications" list, you may need to manually run the Software Update feature in the Apple Menu to add it to the list. 
</ol>

<br>

<b><sup>(4)</sup></b>OpenGL must be installed for Java 3D to run on Solaris/SPARC.
<br>

<b><sup>(5)</sup></b>For Solaris/x86 you must have Java 1.6 and Java 3D 1.4.0 
(or later) installed (comes with the IDV installer, or you can install yourself)
and a compatible video card.  For more information, see:<p>

https://java3d.dev.java.net/binary-builds.html
<br>

<subhead id="disk" intoc="false">Disk Space</subhead>

Using Web Start, you will need about 50 megabytes of disk space for
the IDV-related JAR files downloaded. Additional space will be needed
for the installation of Java, Java 3D, and Web Start, which must be
installed on your system to run the IDV with Web Start.

<p>

Using installer files, you will need about 80-90 MB disk space for the
installer file, which will uncompress into about twice that size. These
include Java and Java3D.


<subhead id="memory" intoc="false">System Memory and Processor Speed</subhead>

The IDV can be demanding of hardware speed and memory depending on the
size of the datasets you wish to work with. It is recommended that
the system have a <b>minimum</b> of 512 MB of RAM free for IDV use.
Performance is significantly better with 1 GB RAM or more.

<p>

Recommended processor speed will vary by platform, but an Intel Pentium
CPU with 1.2 GHz is about the minimum you would need for reasonable
performance. In general, the faster the processor, and the more memory 
your system has, the better IDV performance will be.

<subhead id="video" intoc="false">Graphics Cards</subhead>
The IDV works on systems with graphics cards that support OpenGL (all
systems) and Direct-X (version 9.0+, Windows only).  In most cases,
you should make sure you have the latest video driver for your system.
Even if the system is brand new, the video driver may be old.
<p>
The IDV also works on systems with stereo video cards.  See the
<a href="Faq.html">FAQ</a> on video card for more information.

<subhead id="network" intoc="false">Internet Connection for Downloading 
the IDV, and for Data Sources</subhead>

You will have to download some 60 MB of IDV software initially if you
use the Web Start installation, or some 80-90 MB if you use installer
files which provide Java and Java3D.

<p>

The IDV is designed to access data on remote servers on the
Internet, as well as from local files. Downloading data from remote
servers benefits from a fast connection to the Internet, since many data
fields are large.
