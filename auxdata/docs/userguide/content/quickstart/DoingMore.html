This example shows several ways wind data can be
displayed, focusing on jet stream levels over North America.

<p>

In the bottom of the Field Selector window click on 
<code class="command">Add new data source</code>,
or from the main menu select 
[ug::menu Data {New data source}]. 
In the Data Chooser  window that



<div class="pagesubtitle">Connecting to Gridded Data Source on a Remote Server</div>
<p>
In the bottom of the Field Selector window click on 
<code class="command">Add new data source</code>,
or from the main menu select 
<code class="menu">Data-&gt;New data source</code>. 
In the Data Source Chooser window that opens, 
click on the <b>Gridded data</b> tab.
Choose Catalogs:  https://thredds.ucar.edu/thredds/catalog.xml
and click on <b>Reconnect</b>.

<p>

The box below should fill in, in about 2 to 60 seconds, 
with a list of some 10 categories of NWP model output. 
Open one, such
as NCEP RUC or NCEP Eta, by clicking on the file folder icon.

<p>

The list of available times of model output appears. Click on one
to select it (such as "2003-08-30 12:00:00 GMT"), and then click on 
 the <b>Load data</b> button at bottom. You have connected this 
data source to  the IDV. You have not yet loaded any
wind data to the IDV from the remote server. Loading data
occurs only when a display is made.

<p>

<div class="pagesubtitle">Selecting the display to be made</div>

<p>

After  about 2 to 60 seconds 
the Data Source Chooser window goes away and the name of the data
source you connected to 
appears in the <b>Data sources:</b> panel, probably highlighted.

<p>

In the <b>Fields</b> panel, click on the <b>3D Grid</b> file 
folder icon, or click once on the tiny
round icon to the far left. A list of all 3D 
parameters in the model output appears. Click on the round icon next
to "Derived." We will work with derived parameters
<b>Wind vectors</b> and <b>Windspeed</b>.

<p>"Derived" indicates that these
parameters are computed by the IDV from other data in the data source,
in this case, from u and v wind components.
Wind vectors and speed are termed "derived parameters" -- parameters which the IDV
computes from u and v wind component scalar data.  Nothing is computed
until a display is requested.  
Then the 3D grids  of u and v for one or more times 
are read in, and the wind speed and direction computed, before
any display is made. 
</p>


<div class="pagesubtitle">To make contour plot of wind speed</div>

<p>

In the <b>Displays</b> panel click on <b>Contour Plan View</b>. 
There is  a pause while over million wind speed values
are computed (from Eta AWIPS 211 grids), and then the displays are made.

<p>


The initial plot shows wind speed at the lowest model level (1000
mb).  To shift the level to jet stream levels:
<ul>
<li>Right click on the legend title ("windspeed Contour Plan View")
<li>Click on <b>Control window</b> to bring up this display's Control window
<li>in the Control window, 
click on the <b>Levels:</b> box to bring up the pop-up menu of
native grid levels in the data
<li>slide the slider bar on the right edge if necessary, to see the
value 250.0; then click on 250.0 which is 250 millibars.
</ul>
The plot will move to 250 millibars. To zoom, rotate or pan this 3D
display, see <a href="../ui/Navigation.html">Zoom, Rotate, and
Pan</a>. Rotate the display by dragging the right mouse button
to see the contours are above the surface (map level).
The key combination Ctrl-r will restore the display to the original
overhead view.

<p>

To toggle on the animation loop, click
in the third little box from the left end of the animation controls in the
upper right of the view window. Read more about 
<a href="../ui/Animation.html">Time Animation
Controls</a>.

You can toggle visibility of the plot by clicking on the title of
the <a href="../controls/index.html#legends">Legend</a> "wind speed
Contour Plan View 1000.0"
under the display.



<div class="pagesubtitle">To Display Wind Speed Vectors</div>

Click on <b>Field</b> "Wind vectors (from u and v)."  
In the <b>Displays</b> panel click on <b>Vector Plan View</b>. 
There is a pause while wind vectors are computed from u and v, and
while the display is made.


<p>

The initial plot is at the lowest model level (1000.0 mb). 
To shift the level to jet stream levels, follow 
instructions above.

<p>

The vectors will now appear with the color-filled contours. They may
be too dense.
To see fewer vectors, drag the <b>Skip interval:</b> slider in the
control window to 2.   If you put up displays of wind vectors as just described,
and also "Color-filled Contour Plan View" of wind speed, both at 250
mb, your  display should look something like this:

[ht::cimg ../examples/images/WindVectors.gif]

<div class="pagesubtitle">To Display Wind Streamlines</div>

To see wind streamlines, in the Vector Plan View display's Control
window, click on the 
<b>Show streamlines</b> check box. <b>To see the most accurate stream
lines, make sure the "Skip interval:" slider is on zero, meaning
do not skip any data points when computing streamlines.</b>
</p>
<br>

<div class="pagesubtitle">To Display Wind Barbs</div>

<p>

To see meteorological wind barbs,  
click on parameter (field) "Wind vectors."  
Click on <b>Wind Barb Plan View</b> in the Displays panel.
There is a pause while wind direction is computed from u and v, and
while the display is made. As usual there is a control window
available from the legend.

</p>

<div class="pagesubtitle">To Display a Wind Speed Isosurface</div>

<p>

Click on parameter "Windspeed"  
Click on display type 
"Isosurface."
There is a pause while wind speed is computed from u and v, and
while the display is made.  The isosurface is the most time-demanding
of all display types.

<p>

Here is an oblique view of wind speed as an isosurface of 50 m/s, and
streamlines at 300 mb.  The wind data used here is the
same as in the preceding figure; only the display types differ.
You can toggle off any other displays that may be in the way, by
clicking on their legend labels.
Try rotation (see <a href="../ui/Navigation.html">Zoom, Rotate, and
Pan</a>) and time animation.

[ht::cimg ../examples/images/IsosurfaceExample.gif]

The initial surface has a value of the median wind speed in the 3D
grids of u and v. 
To change the value:
<ul>
<li>Right click on the legend title ("windspeed 3D Isosurface")
<li>Click on <b>Control window</b> to bring up this display's Control window
<li>Slide the slider bar on the <b>Isosurface value:</b> slider to
some speed value you choose.
</ul>

The surface is re-computed for the new value, which may take
some time 10 time steps.

<div class="pagesubtitle">To Display a Vertical Cross Section of Wind Speed</div>

Click on parameter "Windspeed"  
Click on display type 
"Contour Vertical Cross Section."
There is no pause since the wind speed has already been computed; derived grids 
are in case of future reuse.
<p>

Try rotation (see <a href="../ui/Navigation.html">Zoom, Rotate, and
Pan</a>) to see the cross section in the 3D display. 
Or drag the right mouse button to rotate.
You can move the
cross section by dragging on the colored squares at the top corners
and middle of the
cross section with the right mouse button.

<p>

The cross section is also in the 
 <a href="../controls/CrossSectionControl.html">Vertical Cross Section Control </a>
To see this control:
<ul>
<li>Right click on the legend title ("windspeed Contour Cross Section")
<li>Click on <b>Control window</b> to bring up this display's Control window
</ul>

<p>

Other display types that are useful for wind speed (but not wind
vectors or barbs) include:

<ul>
<li><a href="../controls/ProfileControl.html">Vertical Profile</a>
<li><a href="../controls/ProbeControl.html">Data Probe</a>
<li><a href="../controls/TimeHeightControl.html">Time-Height Display</a>
