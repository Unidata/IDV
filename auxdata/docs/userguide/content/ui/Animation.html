<subhead intoc="false" id="animation">Time Animation Widget</subhead>


Each IDV display area or 
View Manager (a view window and controls) has a set of time animation
controls above the view window.

[ht::cimg  ../controls/images/AnimationControls.gif]

The Time Animation Widget controls looping of displays through time.
A series of small green boxes is displayed representing each frame of the animation.
The box corresponding to the current time is colored blue. Click on a box to 
select a different time. Right click on a box to disable that frame in the animation.
Disabled boxes will be colored red.
The time of the data is displayed in the labeled pull-down list and in
the entries of the pull down list on the left. The toolbar of button
icons, on the right, control time animation.
Reading from left to right, the icons on the Time Animation Widget
do the following:

<ul>
<li> Show the first frame, and stop looping if looping is on.
<li> Step Back one frame.
<li> Toggle looping on or off. 
<li> Step Forward one frame.
<li> Show the last frame, and stop looping if looping is on.
<li> Show the Time Animation Properties dialog box.
</ul>

<subhead intoc="false" id="animationprop">Time Animation Properties Dialog</subhead>


Click on the <img src="images/Information16.gif" alt="i"> in the
animation controls to see the Time Animation Properties Dialog box.
This dialog has two tabs. 


[ht::cimg images/AnimationProperties1.gif]

By pressing [ug::button Apply] or [ug::button OK] you will set the properties
in the Animation Widget. If you have the [ug::button Save As Default] button
checked then the properties will be saved off and used every time a new Animation
Widget is created. For example, you may find that you are always setting the
dwell rate to a particular value. You can save that state off as the default
state for all Animation Widgets that are subsequently created, both in the current
run of the IDV and in future runs.

<subhead intoc="false" id="animationsettings">Settings Tab</subhead>


The first tab allows you to change the values that
control looping.  
<p>

The <b>Dwell</b> controls how fast the animation occurs.
Click on the slider icon: <img src="images/Slider16.gif"> to change the values.
Values are seconds/frame.

<ul>
<li><b>Forward</b> controls speed of looping forward.
<li><b>Backward</b> controls speed of looping backwards.
<li><b>First</b> how long first frame is seen.
<li><b>Last</b>  how long last frame is seen.
</ul>



Select the looping style with the [ug::menu Direction] menu.
<ul>
<li><b>Forward</b>  Loop forward in time
<li><b>Backward</b> Loop backward in time
<li><b>Rocking </b> Looping alternates between forward and backward directions.
</ul>

Share the time animation in a display with the animation in other displays with the
[ug::button Share Times] button. 
See <a href="../collab/Sharing.html">here</a> for more information.


<p>
Check [ug::button Boxes Visible] to show the boxes in the Time Animation Widget.
The time boxes allow you  to configure which frames will be disabled in the Time Animation Widget.
This behaves the same as the boxes in the main widget.

<p>
  
You can also set the behavior for when the set of times available changes
with the [ug::menu Reset To] menu. The options are the Start Time, End Time, or No Change.


<subhead intoc="false" id="animationset">Define Animation Times Tab</subhead>
The second tab allows you to define a custom animation time set.

[ht::cimg images/AnimationProperties2.gif]

By default, the times used in the animation time set are all of the times
from the data that is being displayed. However, you can define your own 
time set by selecting the [ug::button Define your own list of times] button. 

<p>
You define how to determine the start time, end time and a 
time interval. The time interval is used to create the set of time steps (inclusive) between the start and
end times.  
The start time and end time modes are determined  one of four  ways:

<ul>
<li> [ug::button Use First/Last Time from Data] This takes the time from the data that is being
displayed.
<li> [ug::button Current Time (Now)] This automatically updates the animation time set
to use the current clock time. This is useful for animation of real time  data. If you select
this option you can then define how often the animation set is updated with the
[ug::button Refresh Rate] field. The [ug::button Round To] field allows you to specify
a rounding factor.
<li> [ug::button Fixed] This mode allows to you to specify a fixed date/time.
<li> [ug::button Relative to End/Start time] This mode uses the other time
as the base time. For example, you could set the end time to be the Current Time. And
set the start time to be relative to the end time minus 1 hour (using the start time
offset field). Note: you cannot have  start and end times both be relative to one another.
</ul>

Once you select the start and end time modes you can define an offset which is added (or subtracted)
to the base time.  To change the offset select the 
<img src="../images/edit.gif"> button. When you do this the [ug::button Offset Dialog] will be shown:
[ht::cimg images/OffsetDialog.gif]
This allows you to define a time offset by entering days, hours and minutes. Note, you can also
specify a sign, &quot;-&quot; or  &quot;+&quot;.


<p>
By pressing apply you can apply the changes that you have made. This is also a good way to
see if there are any errors. For example, the end time cannot be less than the start time.
