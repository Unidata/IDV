</ul>

<h4>Data sources</h4>
<ul> 
<li>{@link ucar.unidata.data.DataSource}
An interface that represents a source of data. The most important method
to the IDV is the getDataChoices method, which returns a list of DataChoice
objects which represents the different choices of data (e.g., parameters, images, etc.)
held by this DataSource.
<li>{@link ucar.unidata.data.DataSourceImpl}
 An abstract implementation of the DataSource interface. Currently used as
the base class for all of our concrete DataSource  classes. It has as attributes
the name and  description of the DataSource. It also holds the DataContext (described below)
and manages the list of DataChoice-s.
<li>{@link ucar.unidata.data.ListDataSource}

<li> Data choices
<ul>
<li>{@link ucar.unidata.data.DataChoice}
This is an abstract class that represents a particular piece of data
within a DataSource.


<li><span class=property>derived.xml</span>
Holds a specification of a set of common derived quantities. The information contained
within this property file is used to create a set of 
{@link ucar.unidata.data.DerivedDataDescriptor}s.
<li>{@link ucar.unidata.data.DerivedDataDescriptor}

</ul>

<p>

<li>{@link ucar.unidata.data.DataCategory}
This class is used to categorize DataChoice-s and to describe what
{@link ucar.unidata.idv.DisplayControl}s are applicable to what data.
<A href=#datacategories</a>See below for more detail</a>.


<li><span class=interface><a href=../data/DataContext.html>DataContext</a></span> The DataContext
is an interface (which the IDV implements). It is meant to represent an object
in which a DataSource is used. There are just 2 methods:
<code>
<br>
public ArrayList getDataSources ();
</code>
<br>
Return the list of all DataSource objects managed by the DataContext.
<br>
<code>
public ArrayList selectDataChoice (ArrayList labels);
<br>
</code>
Select N DataChoice-s, one for each String label in the given labels list.
<br>

<li><a href=../data/DataInstance.html>DataInstance</a>

<li><a href=../data/DataSourceFactory.html>DataSourceFactory</a>
    </ul>
</ul>
<p>



<h4>Displays</h4>
<ul>
<li><span class=interface><a href=DisplayControl.html>DisplayControl</a></span>, 
<span class=class><a href=ControlDescriptor.html>ControlDescriptor</a></span>, 
<span class=class><a href=ControlContext.html>ControlContext</a></span>,
<a href=control/DisplayControlImpl.html>control.DisplayControlImpl</a>.
DisplayControl is an interface that represents all of the classes that can create 
displays of data. 

<li> 
<span class=class><a href=ViewManager.html>ViewManager</a></span>,
<span class=class><a href=MapViewManager.html>MapViewManager</a></span>, 
<span class=class><a href=CrossSectionViewManager.html>CrossSectionViewManager</a></span>.
These classes are self-contained  wrappers around {@link
ucar.visad.display.DisplayMaster}s. They manage a set of DisplayControl-s and provide
their own gui mechanisms: menus, drag-and-drop, etc. 
The <span class=class><a href=ViewContext.html>ViewContext</a></span> is an interface,
implemented by the IDV, that the ViewManager-s use to provide themselves context.
<br>
The  <span class=class><a href=ViewDescriptor.html>ViewDescriptor</a></span>
class contains static names of ViewManagers used by the DisplayControls
to find ViewManagers. This class may evolve over time to provide richer
support for different types and identities of ViewManager-s.
<br>
<span class=class><a href=DisplayInfo.html>DisplayInfo</a></span>
Holds the  triple: DisplayControl, Displayable and ViewManager.


</ul>


<h4>Property files</h4>
<ul>
<li><span class=property><a href=#datasource.xml>datasource.xml</a></span> 
This defines the available data sources.

<li><span class=property><a href=#controls.xml>controls.xml</a></span>
This defines the set of display controls available. 
Holds a set of "control" specifications:
<pre>
  <control
    categories="*-3D-*" 
    class="ucar.unidata.idv.control.ThreeDSurfaceControl" 
    description="Add an isosurface" 
    id="surface" 
    label="Isosurface" 
    icon="/ucar/unidata/idv/images/surface.jpg"
    properties="displayName=3D Isosurface;alpha=1.0;" />
</pre>

that define the java class that implements the control, the categories the control
is applicable to, a description, label, etc. The properties attribute is
a semi-colon delimited list of name=value pairs. These are passed to the DisplayControl
when it is created.

The  data defined in this xml file is is held in the {@link ucar.unidata.idv.ControlDescriptor} class.


<li><span class=property><a href=control/paramtocolor.html>paramtocolor.properties</a></span>
Used by <a href=DisplayConventions.html>DisplayConventions</a> to find default
color table names for different parameter names.

<li><span class=property><a href=control/paramtorange.html>paramtorange.properties</a></span>
Used by <a href=DisplayConventions.html>DisplayConventions</a> to find default
range values for different parameter names.

<li><span class=property><a href=control/contour.html>contour.properties</a></span>
This property file is not used - but sometime it could be used to hold default
contour information for parameters. The reason it isn't used  now is because the
contour information lookup in <a href=DisplayConventions.html>DisplayConventions</a>
uses calculations, not just a straight table lookup.

</ul>

<h4>Glue and Gui  classes</h4>
<ul>
<li><span class=class><a href=IntegratedDataViewer.html>IntegratedDataViewer</a></span>
The main "glue" class. 

<li><span class=class><a href=DefaultIdv.html>DefaultIdv</a></span>
This is derived from IntegratedDataViewer and provides the default GUI.



<li> 
<span class=class><a href=DataTree.html>DataTree</a></span>, 
<span class=class><a href=DataTreeNode.html>DataTreeNode</a></span>,
<span class=class><a href=DataTreeDialog.html>DataTreeDialog</a></span>.
JTree based display of DataSource-s and DataChoice-s. DataTreeNode is a JTree node
and acts as a holder of references to other objects (e.g., DataSource, DataChoice, 
DataCategory).



<li><span class=class><a href=DisplayConventions.html>DisplayConventions</a></span>
Encapsulates a variety of default display conventions, e.g.:,  color tables for
parameters, colors for DisplayControl-s, display units for parameters, etc.


<li><span class=class><a href=SharableImpl.html>SharableImpl</a></span>,
<a href=Sharable.html>Sharable</a>,
<span class=class><a href=SharableManager.html>SharableManager</a></span>.
The IDV provides a "sharable data" framework. The idea is that sharable
objects of certain "types" or "groups" can share data amongst themselves.  The 
<a href=Sharable.html>Sharable</a> interface describes the minimal
interface for "sharable" objects. 
SharableImpl is an abstract class that implements this interface and interacts
with the SharableManager, which has a set of static methods used to
register a Sharable object, organize the Sharable-s based on their
groups and propagate shared  data within  the groups.

<a name=overview>
<H3>The 30000 foot view</H3>
</a>

<p><b>Initialization</b><br>
So, now that we know a bit about what's what here is a short overview of how all of this
gets glued together. It starts by the IDV reading in an xml file (datasource.xml)
that defines the different <a href=../data/DataSource.html>DataSource</a>-s available and what kinds of data (files, url)
they manage and a property file (controls.xml) that defines the different
<a href=control/DisplayControl.html>DisplayControl</a>-s that are available 
(and the kind of data they are applicable to).

<p><b>GUI</b><br>

The IDV creates a <a href=DataTree.html>DataTree</a> (JTree) to 
hold the list of instantiated DataSource-s 
and DataChoice-s. The actual GUI is not created by the IntegratedDataViewer class. Rather
it is created by a concrete derived class of IntegratedDataViewer (e.g., <a href=DefaultIdv.html>DefaultIdv</a>).
This allows for us (in the future) to have different user interfaces. 

<p><b>Loading data</b><br>
When the user picks a file or url to load the pertinent DataSource is found and instantiated.
When the the DataSource is asked for its list of DataChoice-s some of the DataSource-s
will also automatically add <a href=../data/DerivedDataChoice.html>DerivedDataChoice</a>-s to their
list. The DataSource and its list  of DataChoice-s  are then added to the DataTree.
Each  DataChoice has a list of <a href=../data/DataCategory.html>DataCategory</a>-s that describe the flavor of data the DataChoice provides. For each DataChoice the 
DataTree uses the first DataCategory in this list to create a hierarchy of JTree nodes (each one
representing a component of the DataCategory) in which to place the JTree node that represents
the DataChoice.

<p><b>Selecting data</b><br>

When the user clicks on  a particular DataChoice in 
the DataTree  the list of <a href=control/DisplayControl.html>control.DisplayControl</a>-s 
is checked and those DisplayControl-s
which are applicable to any of the DataChoice's DataCategory-s is shown (by default in
a popup menu). When the user selects one of these DisplayControl-s it is
instantiated (through the ControlDescriptor) with the DataChoice and a reference to the
IDV (as a <a href=ControlContext.html>ControlContext</a> interface object).

<p><b>Displaying  data</b><br>

Typically, when a DisplayControl is created
it may have its own <a href=../../visad/display/DisplayMaster.html>DisplayMaster</a> 
(e.g., <a href=control/ProfileControl.html>control.ProfileControl</a>) in its own window
and/or it will want to display some Displayable within a common 
window (e.g., <a href=control/ThreeDSurfaceControl.html>control.ThreeDSurfaceControl</a>). 
For some cases (e.g., <a href=control/TextDisplayControl.html>control.TextDisplayControl</a>)
there will be no use of  the DisplayMaster/Displayable-s.
<p>
The DisplayControl-s don't actually deal with DisplayMaster-s. Rather, they
deal with <a href=ViewManager.html>ViewManager</a>-s which are wrappers
aroung the DisplayMaster.
For common display windows the DisplayControl asks the ControlContext for a 
ViewManager through the:
<br><code>
public ViewManager getViewManager (ViewDescriptor viewDescriptor);
</code><br>
method. This uses an instance of the   <a href=ViewDescriptor.html>ViewDescriptor</a>
to define what kind of ViewManager is needed. Currently we instantiate and
use only one: <a href=MapViewManager.html>MapViewManager</a>.
<p>
The  DisplayControl uses the <a href=DisplayInfo.html>DisplayInfo</a> class to hold
a reference to itself, its Displayable and the ViewManager in which the Displayable
is displayed. This DisplayInfo object is also used by the ViewManager to keep
a list of the DisplayControl-s that are being displayed within it. The ViewManager
uses the DisplayControl method: 
<br><code>Component getLegendComponent ();</code><br>
to retrieve an AWT component to place within its GUI.
This AWT component typically contains a button to popup the DisplayControl's
window  and a checkbox for toggling the visibility of the DisplayControl's Displayable-s.
<p>
Whew!


<A name=datasource.xml>
<H3>Definining the data sources</H3>
</a>
The set of data sources available to the IDV is defined within  the 
datasource.xml file.
This file has the form:
<table>
<tr valign=top><td> <i>data type</i>.factory  </td><td>  The java class name of the DataSourceFactory that is used to create data sources of this type
</td></tr>
<tr valign=top><td><i>data type</i>.label </td><td> Text label used within the gui.
</td></tr>
<tr valign=top><td><i>data type</i>.patterns</td><td> A set of comma separated regular expression patterns to determine if this data source is applicable for a given file or url
</td></tr>
<tr valigntop><td><i>data type</i>.default_display </td><td>   Name of a default display control to create when data sources of this type are loaded.
</td></tr>
<tr valigntop><td><i>data type</i>.show_in_tree </td><td>   Optional boolean that defines if data sources of this type are placed within the gui.

</table>
<p>
For example, for files or urls that are textual or html we have the <i>TEXT</i>
data source type: 
<pre>TEXT.label = Text or html files
TEXT.factory  = ucar.unidata.data.text.TextDataSource
TEXT.patterns=.htm$,.html$,.txt$,.text$,http
TEXT.default_display = textdisplay
TEXT.show_in_tree = false
</pre>



This data source type is applicable to anything that ends with .htm, .html,
.txt or .text (The $ used in the patterns represents the end of line character
in a regular expression.). For this data source the IDV will automatically
create a DisplayControl of type <i>textdisplay</i> and the data source
will not be placed within the GUI (e.g., within the JTree of DataSource-s).
<p>
On initialization the IDV reads in the properties file and a set of
{@link ucar.unidata.util.PatternFileFilter}s are created
which hold the regular expression patterns define in the properties file.
These PatterFileFilters also hold an <code>Object id</code> attribute
which the IDV uses to hold the String data type name.
<p>
This set of PatternFileFilters is used in two ways. The first way is when the user
is selecting a local data set using a FileChooser. The  PatternFileFilters
are used as filters for the FileChooser.


<A name=controls.xml>
<H3>Definining the display controls</H3>
</A>
The IDV reads in the controls.properties file to determine the set of DisplayControl-s
available. This properties file holds a comma separated list
(<i>displays</i>) of a set of display control names, e.g.:<pre>
displays=planviewflow, surface, profile, contourxs, contourcolor, planviewcontour, ...
</pre>
These display control names are used to do subsequent lookups in the property
file. We use this list (instead of enumerating across the keys of the Properties) so
there is an ordering of the display controls when interacting with the user.
It is important that when adding new displays to this list there are no line breaks.
<p>

Each control name in the list is used to look up the actual DisplayControl class  name, 
its description and the data categories this DisplayControl  is applicable to, e.g.:
<pre>
windbarbplan.class=ucar.unidata.idv.control.FlowPlanViewControl
windbarbplan.label=Wind Barb Plan View
windbarbplan.desc = Add a wind barb plan view of flow vectors
windbarbplan.categories = macro.windvector
windbarbplan.properties = windbarbs=true;
</pre>
Here we have a display control with id <code>windbarbplan</code>. It is implemented by the 
<a href=control/FlowPlanViewControl.html>control.FlowPlanViewControl</a> class.
The <code>windbarbplan.categories</code> entry defines the data categories this
display control is applicable to. Note the value is <code> macro.windvector</code>.
This value is actually a reference to another entry  in the properties file:<pre>
macro.windvector = *-windvector-*
</pre>
In general, when the IDV deals with property files it uses a macro substitution
mechanism (defined in {@link ucar.unidata.util.Misc#getValue}). The value
of a property is scanned for anything of the form: <code>macro.some_name</code>.
The value of the property <code>macro.some_name</code> is  then used to do a
textual substitution. Any macro's defined in the value of a macro property
are <em>not</em> substituted. The value of the original  
property can hold any number of macro strings. 
<p>
The categories  field is a semi-colon (";") delimited set of
data category strings. Each data category specification
is a dash ("-") delimited set of category components. So a data category
can be viewed  as a hierarchy or path of components. 
For example, you could have a  categories entry:<pre>
textdisplay.categories = text;html
</pre>
This says that the <code>textdisplay</code> DisplayControl is applicable
to any data which has data category of <code>text</code> or <code>html</code>.
Now lets suppose we know there is data available that is html but has a more
complex categorization, perhaps html that is weather related e.g.:<pre>
html.weather
</pre>
In this case we might have a specialized display control that knows how to deal with
these <code>html-weather</code> categorized data. In this case we would have
a data category like:<pre>
special_html_display.categories= html-weather
</pre>
This special category would only be applicable to the special "html-weather" data.
However, this data is still "html" like data and we would also want the <code>textdisplay</code>
DisplayControl to be able to display this data. To do this we can take advantage
of the regular  expression capability of data categories. Each component of a data
category can also be a regular expression. So we could change the category
of the <code>textdisplay</code> to be:<pre>
textdisplay.categories = *-text-*;*-html-*
</pre> 
This states that the  <code>textdisplay</code> is applicable to any data 
that has a category that contains "text" as a component.  This can be read
as: 0 or more (arbitrary) components followed by a "text" component followed by 0 or more 
(arbitrary)  components.
<br>
Another example:<pre>
2D-TIME-*
</pre>
is read as any category  that  begins with the components "2D" and "TIME" and ends
with 0 or more components.
<br>
We can also use the "+" to represent 1 or more and the "." to represent one, e.g.:<pre>
2D-TIME-+ (2D-TIME followed by one or more components)
2D-TIME-. (2D-TIME followed by one component)
2D-TIME-.-FOO (2D-TIME followed by one component followed by FOO)
</pre>
One could also use richer regular expressions here but it has not been thouroughly tested
(and needed) yet. Note: currently a string representation of a category is parsed
(in <a href=../data/DataCategory.html>DataCategory</a>) using a StringTokenizer,
breaking on "-". So if you use a regular expression that contains a "-" (e.g., [A-Z]+),
this will break. Sometime in the future we'll tokenize smarter to allow for
escapes, e.g.: [A\-Z]+.
<p>
The control data read in from the controls.properties is held 
in the <a href=ControlDescriptor.html>ControlDescriptor</a> class. This
class has methods for testing whether the DisplayControl it represents
is applicable to some DataCategory (ControlDescriptor.applicableTo) and
for instantiating the DisplayControl (ControlDescriptor.doMakeDisplay).


<H3>Creating a new DataSource object</H3>
When the user selects some file or url the data type is found with the call
to the IntegratedDataViewer method:
<code> private String getDataType (String file);</code>
This method iterates through the list of  PatternFileFilters 
created with the <a href=#datasource.properties>datasource.properties</a> 
to find the one that matches the file. If found then the id of the PatternFileFilter
is returned. If no pattern matches the IDV has a special case of a url
that points to an html file but does not match the ".html" pattern.
If the string url begins with "https://" then it is assumed the data source
of of type "TEXT".

<p>
Once the data type is found the factory class defined by the properties file
is instantiated  by the IDV method:
<p>
<code>
private DataSource createDataSource (Object dataName, String dataType, String globalId);
</code>
<p>
This method takes a  specification of the data that is to be loaded
in, <code>Object dataName</code> and the data type <code>String dataType</code>.
The <code>globalId</code> is used for persistence and may evolve in the future.
The dataName typically specifies a String file name or url but may hold anything
(e.g., a list of images).
The DataSource that handles this data is constructed using a reflection based factory pattern.
The factory class name that creates this data source is found from the properties file.
<br>
<code>
String factoryClassName  = (String) dataSourceProperties.get (dataType+".factory");
<br>
Class  factoryClass = Class.forName (factoryClassName);
</code>

<br>
This class <em>must</em> provide a constructor that takes two arguments: a DataContext
and the class of the dataName argument:<br>
<code>
Constructor ctor = factory.getConstructor (new Class[]{DataContext.class, dataName.getClass()});
<br>
DataSourceFactory factory= (DataSourceFactory) ctor.newInstance (new Object[]{(DataContext)this, dataName});<br>
</code>
<br>
The <a href=../data/DataContext.html>DataContext</a> is an interface which the 
IDV implements.
The data source is then retrieved:
<br>
<code>
DataSource dataSource = factory.getDataSource ();
</code>
<br>
It turns out that so far all of the DataSourceFactory-ies are actually the concrete DataSource
classes (e.g., <a href=../data/grid/GeoGridDataSource.html>GeoGridDataSource</a>,
<a href=../data/imagery/ImageDataSource.html>ImageDataSource</a>). These classes all derive
from <a href=../data/DataSourceImpl.html>DataSourceImpl</a> which implements the
DataSourceFactory interface by just returning "this" for the getDataSource method.
<p>
Once  a DataSource has been instantiated the method 
<code>IntegratedDataViewer.loadDataSource</code> is called.
This method does a couple of things. First it runs through the  list of initial paramaters
and displays (defined via the command line with the "-display" argument, see <a href=#commandline> Command line arguments</a>), creating the display for any matching parameters held by the
DataSource.
<br>
Next, any default displays defined for that data source in the <a href=#datasource.properties>datasource.properties</a> are created. Finally, the dataSource is added to the <A href=DataTree.html>DataTree</a> if the "show_in_tree" property for that dataSource (defined in the <a href=#datasource.properties>datasource.properties</a> file) is true.
<p>
  

<a name=datacategories>
<h4>DataCategory</h4>
</a>
A data category is hierarchical and can be described as a string:
<pre>component1-component2-...-componentN</pre>
We use dashes ("-") to delimit each sub-component.
An instance of a  DataCategory class represents one of the sub-components.
A DataCategory has a reference to a parent DataCategory and a child DataCategory.
For example, the string FOO-BAR-ZOO is represented by three DataCategory objects:
<pre>
 +-----+     +-----+     +-----+
 | FOO |-->  | BAR | --> | ZOO |
 +-----+     +-----+     +-----+
</pre>
The DataCategory class has a number of  static utility methods for parsing
a string and returning a DataCategory object and for parsing a set of
semi-colon delimited categories and returning a list of DataCategory objects.
