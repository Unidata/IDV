<%nochildlist%>

IDV plugins are a way to add to or modify the functionality
of the IDV. Plugins can range from adding new resources (e.g.,
color tables, layout models, maps) to changing the entire application.
Plugins are typically Java JAR archive files that can contain
a set of IDV resources and Java code. They are kept in
a special directory on disk and are loaded at run time.


<div class="pagesubtitle">Plugin Command Line Arguments</div>
You can load a plugin (one time only) with the:<pre>
-plugin &lt;plugin file or URL&gt;</pre>
command line argument.

<p>
You can install  a plugin with the:<pre>
-installplugin &lt;plugin file or URL&gt;</pre>
command line argument.
<p>
You can start the IDV without any plugins with the:<pre>
-noplugins</pre>
command line argument.


<div class="pagesubtitle">Plugin Manager</div>

The Plugin Manager, accessed through 
the [ug::menu Tools {Plugin Manager}] menu,
allows you to list, install and manage plugins. 
[ht::cimg images/PluginManager.gif  {Plugin Manager}]
<p>

A list of the installed and available plugins is shown.
The available plugins are those the the IDV development
team makes available through. One can install plugins
that are not in this list through the 
[ug::menu File {Install Plugin from File}] and 
[ug::menu File {Install Plugin from URL}] menu items.
When you install a plugin you will need to restart the
IDV for the plugin to take effect.

<p>
For installed plugins the Manager allows you to delete and
reinstall the plugin. <b>Note: When you delete a plugin
it is only deleted when you exit the IDV.</b>

<p>
The small binocular icon allows you to list the files that
the plugin contains. This brings up the Plugin List dialog:
[ht::cimg images/PluginList.gif  {Plugin List}] 
You can  view the contents of a file and/or extract a file through
this dialog.
