You use preferences to save standard settings of the IDV, such as the map
projection to show when the IDV starts.
The Preferences Dialog  is  opened through the
<a href="../ui/Menus.html#edit">Edit menu</a>
with [ug::menu Edit  {Preferences}].

<p>
Note: Some of these preferences only take effect the next time
you run the IDV or when you create a new view window.
The preferences also may be overwritten when you use bundles.
See <a href="../Bundles.html">here</a> for more information about 
the bundle facility.

[ug::prefGroup {General Preferences}]

[ht::cimg images/preferences/General.gif {General Preferences}]

Click on Cancel if you wish to exit preferences setting, Ok to
accept the changed preferences and close this window, and Apply to
accept the preferences and keep this window open.


[ug::prefSubGroup {General}]

[ug::preference {Show Help Tip Dialog On Start} ]
Should the  help tip window be shown at start up.

[ug::preference {Confirm Before Exiting}]
Ask user to confirm before the application exits.

[ug::preference {Show Dashboard On Start}]
Should the dashboard window be shown when the IDV starts.

[ug::preference {Show Hidden Files in File Chooser}]
Should the file choosers show hidden files.

[ug::preference {Show Toolbar in Windows}]
Should the main toolbar (actions and Toolbar Favorite Bundles) be shown in
new windows.


[ug::prefSubGroup {When Opening a Bundle}]

[ug::preference {Prompt user to remove displays and data}]
Allows you to control if the prompt dialog is shown before a bundle is opened.

[ug::preference {Remove all displays and data sources}]
Allows you to specify
that before a bundle is loaded  should all the existing data and displays be removed.

[ug::preference {Ask where to put zipped data files}]
When opening a data bundle (zidv), should the user be prompted where to
save the data files?

[ug::prefSubGroup {Display Controls}]

[ug::preference {Show windows when they are created}]
Specifies that when a display is
created its control window is automatically shown.

[ug::preference {Show icons in legend}]
If this is unchecked, the remove and lock icons will not be displayed in the legend.

[ug::preference {Use Fast Rendering}]
Should the displays always use fast rendering. This allows for faster display rendering
at the risk of incorrect displays (e.g., when display lines cross projection seams).

[ug::preference {Auto-select data when loading a template}]
A display can be saved as a template without data. When it is created should the IDV
attempt to automatically select the appropriate data fields.



[ug::prefSubGroup {When Display Control is Closed}]


[ug::preference {Remove the display}]
Specifies that when a display's window
is closed then the display itself is removed.

[ug::preference {Remove standalone displays}]
When the window is closed for a stand alone display (i.e., one that does
not have a display component in a main view window. e.g., html display)
should the display be removed.


[ug::prefSubGroup {Other}]

[ug::preference {Resource Sitepath}]
Allows you to define where the 
IDV looks for additional resources. Use this when you want to
have a set of resources shared by a group of users. See
the <a href="../SiteConfiguration.html"> Site Configuration</a>
documentation for more details.


[ug::preference {Look and  Feel}]
Define the Java look and feel to use. This will take effect when you next run the IDV.





[ug::prefGroup Formats and Data]

[ht::cimg images/preferences/FormatsAndData.gif {Formats and Data Preferences}]

[ug::preference {Date Format}]
This allows you to define how the IDV displays dates. 
The date format string  uses the following symbols. Note, these symbols can
be repeated to give different results. For example:
<pre>
&quot;MMMM&quot; gives full month name
&quot;MMM&quot; gives short month name
&quot;MM&quot; gives  2 digit month number
&quot;M&quot; gives  1 or 2 digit month number
</pre>

<table>
<tr><td>Symbol</td><td>Description</td><td>Example</td></tr>
<tr><td>G  </td><td>	Era designator 	</td><td>  	AD</td></tr>
<tr><td>y </td><td>	Year 	</td><td> 	1996; 96</td></tr>
<tr><td>M </td><td>	Month in year 	</td><td> 	July; Jul; 07</td></tr>
<tr><td>w </td><td>	Week in year 	</td><td> 	27</td></tr>
<tr><td>W </td><td>	Week in month 	</td><td> 	2</td></tr>
<tr><td>D </td><td>	Day in year 	</td><td> 	189</td></tr>

<tr><td>Z </td><td>	RFC 822 Time zone 	</td><td>-0800</td></tr>
</table>




[ug::preference {Time Zone}]
Choose the time zone to display time with.



[ug::preference {Lat/Lon Format} {latlonformat}]
Format used when showing lat/lon. This is a normal decimal format that can 
contain the symbols:
<table>
 <tr><td>0<tr><td>Digit</td></tr>  
 <tr><td>#</td><td>Digit, zero shows as absent</td></tr>  
 <tr><td>.</td><td>Decimal separator or monetary decimal separator</td></tr>  
 <tr><td>-</td><td>Minus sign</td></tr>  
 <tr><td>,</td><td>Grouping separator</td></tr>  
 <tr><td>E</td><td>Separates mantissa and exponent in scientific notation.</td></tr>  
 <tr><td>;</td><td>Subpattern boundary Separates positive and negative subpatterns</td></tr>    
</table>

[ug::preference {Number Style}]
Choose the formatting style for numbers such as the lat/lon readout
and color table range.  System Default uses the default regionalization 
set for your computer.  English/US uses a period for the decimal separator.
You need to restart the IDV for this to take effect.


[ug::preference {Probe format}]
This defines an html template that is used to display data readouts in
the data probe display. This html template can contain macros that are replaced
with the probed values.
Macros are:
<br>%value% Formatted value
<br>%unit% Display unit
<br>%rawvalue% Unformatted value
<br>%rawunit% Original unit



[ug::preference {Distance Unit}] 
When displaying distances (e.g., in the Range and Bearing Control) this is the default unit that is used.



[ug::preference {Sampling Mode}]
You can specify  the type of sampling you want for the various data probes.  Choose between a weighted average sampling or nearest neighbor.

[ug::preference {Pressure to Height}]
You can specify  the type of algorithm you want to use for converting from pressure coordinates to height.  See the <a href="../Faq.html#pressure_to_height">FAQ</a> for more information on this option.



[ug::prefGroup View]

The <b>View</b> tab allows you to set preferences related to the
main 3D map view window.

[ht::cimg images/preferences/MainDisplay.gif {View Preferences}]


[ug::prefSubGroup Legends]
[ug::preference {Show Side Legend}]
Do you  prefer the side display  legend.

[ug::preference {Show Bottom Legend}]
Do you  prefer the bottom display  legend.

[ug::preference {Show Animation Boxes}]
Do you  prefer seeing the animation boxes in the time animation control.

[ug::preference {Show Overview Map}]
A 3D display can have a small overview map shown under the legend.
Note: This is kind of flaky.


[ug::prefSubGroup Display]

[ug::preference {Show Wireframe Box}]
Toggles the  visibility of a 3D wireframe box around the data. This box 
helps provide orientation in 3D views.


[ug::preference {Show Cursor Readout}]
Display a label of latitude,
longitude, and altitude of the cursor position over the display, shown
in the lower border of the view window.


[ug::preference {Clip View At Box}]
Allows you to elide from view 
all display elements outside the wireframe box. This is helpful to 
remove map lines outside the area of data.


[ug::preference {Show Display List}]
Should a listing of the titles and times of the display controls be shown in the
main view window.


[ug::preference {Show Times In Display}]
Turn on the label, shown inside the main display, 
that shows the current animation time.

[ug::preference {Show Map Display Scales}]
Show a vertical scale in the map displays.


[ug::preference {Show TransectDisplay Scales}]
Show a vertical scale in the transect displays.

[ug::preference {Show &quot;Please Wait&quot; Message}]
Display the &quot;Please Wait&quot; message in the display.


[ug::preference {Reset Projection With New Data}]
When checked will cause each new
display made in the IDV to snap the whole view window to the native projection of the
data. This can be undesirable if you are overlaying several kinds of
some of which have differing projections.


[ug::preference {Use 3D View}]
Allows you to override the default 3D behavior of the IDV and use
a 2D View for Map Views.

[ug::preference {Show Globe Background}]
In a globe display, show a solid background if this is selected.  The 
default color of the background can be set in the Color Scheme section.


[ug::prefSubGroup {Default Projection}]
You can specify the default map projection used in a new map view window.


[ug::prefSubGroup Toolbars]

[ug::preference {Show Earth Navigation Panel}]
Show a graphical navigation panel. 

[ug::preference {Show Viewpoint Toolbar}] 
Enable the <a href="../ui/Navigation.html#viewpoint">Viewpoint toolbar</a>.

[ug::preference {Show Zoom/Pan Toolbar}] 
Enable the <a href="../ui/Navigation.html#navigation">Zoom/Pan toolbar</a>.

[ug::preference {Show Undo/Redo Toolbar}] 
Enable the <a href="../ui/Navigation.html#undoredo">Undo/Redo toolbar</a>.


[ug::prefSubGroup {Color Scheme}]
You can specify the 
default foreground/background colors, the selected panel highlight and
the globe background color. The foreground  color is applied to
the bounding box lines and the time readout. The color of the  maps
is controlled by the individual 
<a href="../controls/MapDisplayControl.html">map control</a>.

[ug::prefSubGroup {Contour Labels}]
You can specify the default font, font size and alignment of the
countour labels.  These can be overridden in each individual contour
display control through the 
<a href="ContourDialog.html">Contour Properties Editor</a>.

[ug::prefSubGroup {Display List Properties}]
The default font, font type and font size as well as the color of the display
list labels in the view window can be set here.  These preferences can be 
overridden in each View's Properties dialog.

[ug::prefSubGroup {Logo}]
Each View can have a logo image displayed in it.  These preferences 
control the logo used, whether it is shown and the positioning and 
sizing of the logo.  These preferences can be overridden for each 
individual View throught its Properties dialog.

[ug::prefGroup Navigation]

You can change how the IDV interprets mouse and keyboard events for navigating in 
3D space. 
For each combination of mouse button and control/shift keys  you can select an action.


[ht::cimg images/preferences/Mouse.gif {Mouse Event Preferences}]



There are a number of navigation functions (e.g., rotate) that can be triggered
by a key press. The Keyboard preference tab allows you to define the key and
any modifier (i.e., control, shift):

[ht::cimg images/preferences/Keyboard.gif {Keyboard Event Preferences}]



[ug::prefGroup {Toolbar}]

Allows you to define what action/icons are displayed in the toolbar. The list on the
left shows all of the available actions. The list on the right
shows the actions which make up the toolbar. You can add/remove actions
to/from the toolbar list. The [ug::button Add space] button adds a space
between toolbar entries. The [ug::button Reload Original] resets the toolbar
list to the one before any changes have been made.
The [ug::button Reload System] button resets  the toolbar list to
the original one defined in the system.

[ht::cimg images/preferences/Toolbar.gif {Toolbar Preferences}]

[ug::prefGroup Available Choosers]

The <b>Available Choosers</b> tab  allows you to define what types of data 
choosers to use. This is a way to simplify the data chooser window,
only showing those tabs that you want to use.
You can either select
to  &quot;Use all choosers&quot; or
&quot;Use selected choosers&quot;
and select individual choosers to use.

[ht::cimg images/preferences/Choosers.gif {Chooser Preferences}]

[ug::prefGroup Available Displays]


The <b>Available Displays</b> tab allows you to specify  what types of displays to 
fuse. You can either select to 
&quot;Use all displays&quot; 
or
&quot;Use selected displays&quot;.
The list of displays is hierarchical. You can turn on or off
the user of all displays, specific groupings or individual
displays. 

[ht::cimg images/preferences/Displays.gif {Display Preferences}]

[ug::prefGroup System]

The <b>System</b> tab allows you to change the system settings such 
as the amount of memory allocated to the IDV, data caching, threading and
some Java 3D settings.  In order for these changes to take effect, 
the user will have to restart the IDV. 

[ht::cimg images/preferences/System.gif {System Preferences}]

[ug::preference  {Memory}]
You can set the amount of memory allocated to the IDV as a percentage of
the total system memory or a specific amount (in megabytes).  On 32-bit
systems, the maximum is 1.5 gigabytes (1500 MB).

[ug::preference  {PermGen Size}]
You can adjust the amount of "PermGenSpace" that the IDV uses if you are
getting errors.  This has been particularly a problem on Mac OS-X which
has a default size of 64Mb.  If you have problems with "PermGenSpace" errors,
set the value to 128 or higher.  The total of Memory and PermGenSpace should
not exceed your system memory (or the maximum allowable).

[ug::preference  {Cache Data in Memory}]
The IDV normally tries to cache data that it loads in memory. You can turn this behavior off with a preference.

[ug::preference  {Disk Cache Size}]
The IDV will cache some data sets to disk to eliminate network latency.  Specify the maximum amount of disk size with this preference.

[ug::preference  {Write Grib Index in Disk Cache}]
The IDV will normally cache grib data index sets to disk in the default directory: .unidata/idv/DefaultIdv/tmp/nj22.  If you uncheck this box,
the IDV will save those index sets to the same directory as the grib datasets. When you make the change, you need to restart the IDV for this
change to take effect, and you need to make sure the write permission on this data directory.

[ug::preference  {Thread Count}]
The IDV can do processing in multiple threads. This allows one to take advantage of mulitple core chip architectures.
One can set both the thread count for rendering and for data reading. 
For rendering, each time step for each display is rendered separately.
We suggest that for rendering running with 2 threads is optimal. We have not seen large improvements
with a higher number of threads (due to memory issues). Also, it is easy to exceed the maximum memory
amount if one is rendering in a large number of threads.
<p>
The data reading thread count is how many parallel reads (e.g., per time step) there are when accessing data
on remote servers (e.g., THREDDS/OpenDAP, ADDE).
There is no optimal thread count for data reading because it depends on the configuration of the server machine.
We have found that 4 works well.


[ug::preference {Max Image Size}]
This field allows you to set a maximum image size (in pixels) that is to be displayed.
When this preference is set the image display will adjust the Pixel Sampling to
reduce the image to less than the preferred value. This allows for the initial
display of large images without causing  memory issues.

[ug::preference {Java 3D}]
These preferences control some Java 3D settings that reduce memory usage when
checked.
<ul>
<li><b>Enable geometry by reference</b> - does not copy geometries (lines,
triangles, etc).  If you have problems with spurious map lines, turn this
off.</li>
<li><b>Enable access to image data by reference</b> - does not copy image textures</li>
<li><b>Enable Non-Power of Two (NPOT) textures - USE WITH CAUTION</b> - 
by default, all textures (images, color shaded displays) are expanded to 
fill a power of two (e.g. 512, 1024, etc) size.  By checking this, the 
renderer will not expand the size to a power of 2.  This is not well tested 
and does not work on all systems. </li>
</ul>
