{Storm Track Control}

{
<%nochildlist%>

The Storm Track Control displays tropical storm observation and model output tracks.
Currently the IDV supports both 
the <a href="http://www.nrlmry.navy.mil/atcf_web/index1.html">Automated Tropical Cyclone Forecasting System (ATCF)</a>
data as well as data from the <a href="http://www.sti.org.cn/">Shanghai Typhoon Institute</a>.
<p>
To  load in  ATCF data select the  [ht::menu Data Special {ATCF Tropical Storm Data}] menu.
This creates a data source with a predefined
path to the National Hurricane Center ftp site. Then, create the Storm Track display.
<p>
The display control shows the set of available storms on the  left panel organized by year and basin,
e.g., Atlantic (AL), Eastern Pacific (EP) and Central Pacific (CP).


<subhead id="yearly" intoc="false">Year Display</subhead>
At the top of the list is an option  (Yearly Tracks) which allows the user to display the observed tracks
for all the storms in a given year. You can load and/or unload any number of years worth
of observed tracks. The color  swatch changes the color of the tracks for a given year.
The Time Mode menu allows one to change the animation mode, e.g., use the year or use the storm start time.

To show the observation and all of the model results for a single storm 
select the storm in the list and press the [ug::button Load Tracks] button.
You can load any number of storms but they are shown in different panels.
You can use the [ht::menu View {Storm Tracks}] menu to list out all of the loaded storms,
remove them all, etc. Once a storm is loaded it can be removed with the small &quot;scissors&quot;
icon shown in the upper right.

<p>
Once a storm is loaded 
the first thing you should do is to specify which &quot;Techs&quot; (or models) to use by 
bringing up the control's Properties dialog [ht::menu Edit Properties] menu.
In the &quot;Techs to use&quot; tab,  select all of the Techs in the &quot;Use&quot; list (click and press control-a)
and press [ug::button Remove]. This places them in the &quot;Don't Use&quot; list.
Select the desired Techs in the &quot;Don't use&quot; list and press Add.  
You can also choose what parameters are to be used and displayed in the 
&quot;Chart Parameters&quot; tab, repeat the same step to select the desired parameters. 
If you want these selections
to be saved as a preference, please check the &quot;Save as Preference&quot; box.

The Storm display panel  consists of three tabs: <a href="#tracks">Tracks</a>,

and <a href="#chart">Storm Chart</a>.


<subhead id="tracks" intoc="false">Tracks</subhead>

The  [ug::button Tracks] tab  controls the display and animation of the tracks.
<p>
The [ug::button Points] menus specify which Layout Model
to use for both the Observation as well as the Forecast tracks.
<p>

The [ug::button Animation] is the layout model to use for the Observation track
that moves along with the time animation.
<p>
The [ug::button Animation Mode] determines whether to animate the tracks or show
all of the tracks.
<p>
Using the  [ug::button Color By] menus one can specify whether the track is shown with a fixed color
or using a color table. The color table used is a single one for the entire display control
and is set through the main [ht::menu Edit] menu.
<p>
Under the [ug::button Show] table one can specify what is to be shown.
One can toggle on/off the visiblity of the Observation track, all of the forecast tracks
or individual forecast tracks.



<subhead id="table" intoc="false">Table</subhead>

The Table tab shows a tabular listing of all of the observational track data
and individual forecast model  runs.
On the left is a tree view organized by the Tech and model run time.
Selecting one of the model runs will display the  data in the table.
The main [ht::menu File Save {Export to Spreadsheet}] menu allows you to export
the track data to an Excel spreadsheet. In the File Dialog are options to
select what is to be saved.

<subhead id="chart" intoc="false">Storm Chart</subhead>

The Storm Chart tab shows time series charts of selected tracks.
Under the main [ht::menu Edit ] menu you can any number of new forecast time or
forecast hour charts. The forecast time chart is based around the model run time
of the selected forecasts. The forecast hour charts selects data across the different
model run times, e.g., you can show the 12 hour forecast from each model run.

<p>

To do the charting of the storm track, one or more Techs need to be selected.
Once selected the Forecast Hour/Forecast Time list is populated. One or more
times can be selected (control-click).
Each Parameter that is selected will result in a new chart shown on the right.
<p>
The [ug::button Use Difference] button, when selected, results in the display of the difference between
the forecast value and the observed value.
