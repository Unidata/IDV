Bundles let you save a quick "snapshot" of the IDV, including data      
sources, maps, data displays. Bundles are small information files       
that specify the state of the IDV. They are a kind of configuration     
file. They include information about what data sources are in use, and  
which parameters from the data sources are displayed, and how they are  
displayed.

<p>
The purpose of bundles is for you to save a particular IDV setup and    
display. A bundle can be used for your own reference at a later time.   
Others using the IDV can use bundles you made to see data the same      
way you did.


<p>
To make a new bundle file select the [ug::mmenu File {Save As}] menu.    
A pop-up window will let you set a new file location and name:
[ht::cimg images/FileDialog.gif {Bundle File Dialog}]
The customary IDV bundle filename extension is       
<b>.xidv</b>; if you do not enter a file extension, .xidv will be       
appended. You may use any other file extension you like.                

<p>
Note: For bundle files to work the data must be available in exactly    
the same way you made connection to it when you made the bundle file.   
Others who use your bundles must have access to the same file system or 
to the same remote or local data servers you use, so that file paths or 
URLs to the data are exactly the same.                                  

<p>
The file dialog has a set of buttons on the right that allow you to 
save off (or not save off) different components of the IDV state.
<ul>
<li>
The [ug::button Views] button is related to the windows and views.
<li> Checking  off the [ug::button Displays] button will not include any
of the created displays. 

<li> The [ug::button Data Sources] button allows for you to not include any
of the data sources. When reading in a bundle that had been saved
without data sources and with displays  the IDV will prompt the user for
the data to be used. For example, you can create  a set of displays
of a gridded data set (e.g., Temperature, Relative Humidity, etc.)
This state can be saved off without the data sources. When you load this 
bundle back in again the IDV will prompt the user for the required data
fields. This allows you to essentially save off a display template
that can be used for different data sets.

<li>
The [ug::button Jython] menu allows you to save off in different
ways the Jython code you may have in your library. Say for example
you have written some custom Jython code that implements a Formula.
You have a display that uses the results of that computation.
To include your local Jython code just select [ug::button All Jython]
or [ug::button Selected Jython]. When loading in a bundle that has had 
Jython code saved with it the user will be prompted for what to do
with the Jython.

<li>
<a name="relative"></a>
One can save a bundle with data paths that are relative to where
the bundle is loaded from by checking 
the [ug::button Save with relative paths] checkbox. The IDV
will change the file based data sources to point to the directory
where the bundle is loaded from. For example, you can use this
to save a bundle that references model files on disk. Copy the bundle
and the model files over to a thumb drive or CD. Then when you load 
the bundle the files are relative to the bundle path.

<li>
The [ug::button Enable user to change data] button, when checked, will
configure the bundle so that when it is loaded the user will be able
to change the file paths or URLS that point to data sets.


</ul>



<subhead id="open" intoc="false">Opening a Bundle</subhead>

Use the [ug::mmenu File Open] menu to open a bundle. 
When loading in a new bundle you will be prompted whether the   
current displays and data should be removed. You can also start up
the IDV with a bundle file or URL in the command line.                            


<subhead id="jnlp" intoc="false">JNLP Bundles</subhead>
You can also save a bundle inside a &quot;jnlp file&quot; that can be   
used to start the IDV with the bundle. Use a filename extension of      
&quot;.jnlp&quot; in place of .xidv. This file, when used as a link on  
a regular web page, allows IDV users to start the IDV with Web Start on 
their system with your bundle. Click on the link to your jnlp file. The 
IDV will start with the bundle you saved in the .jnlp file.             




<subhead id="default" intoc="false">The Default Bundle</subhead>
Select the [ug::mmenu File {Default Bundle} Save] menu to create a       
bundle that is read whenever you start the IDV. This will provide a     
standard starting configuration. You can set up the geographic area,    
map projection, and maps you prefer, for example.                       



<subhead id="favorites" intoc="false">Favorite Bundles</subhead>
Favorite bundles are just normal bundles that are categorized and
saved  off in a particular location on disk and serve as a
convenience to the user. This allows the user to organize their
favorites by category and readily load them in.

<p>
Favorite bundles come in 3 forms: as regular bundles, as display templates
and as favorite data sources. Each of these types of favorites can be
accessed through the [ug::mmenu Displays] menu as well as through
the <a href="ui/Dashboard.html#quicklinks"> Dashboard</a>.

<p>
A regular favorite bundle can be created through the [ug::mmenu File {Save As Favorite...}]
[ug::mmenu Displays {Favorite Bundles} {Save As Favorite...}] menus.
The &quot;Save As Favorite&quot; dialog is shown:
 
[ht::cimg images/SaveAsFavorite.gif {Save As Favorite Dialog}]

A favorite bundle has a category which can be entered in the  [ug::button Category] field.
Categories can be hierarchical, using a &quot;&gt;&quot; as separator. For example:
&quot;Toolbar&gt;Weather&quot;
The &quot;Toolbar&quot; category is special. These will result in links in the toolbar.
After specifying a category specify a Name for the favorite bundle.
<p>

The Display Templates favorites are created through the [ug::menu File {Save Display as Favorite}]
menu. This allows you to create a display as you like (e.g., a Contour Plan View at a certain level
with certain settings), save it off and recreate it later. Display Templates for displays that
showed data will show up in the Displays component of the Field Selector. 
<p>
Data Source favorites are created through the Data Source popup menu in the Field Selector.
<p>
Each of these types of favorites can be with the Favorites Manager:

[ht::cimg images/FavoritesManager.gif {Favorites Manager}]

This is brought up through the Quicklinks in the Dashboard or through the
[ug::mmenu Displays {Favorites Bundles}  {Manage...}],
[ug::mmenu Displays {Display Templates}  {Manage...}] and
[ug::mmenu Displays {Data Sources}  {Manage...}]
menus.
The Favorites Manager allows you to reorganize the categories and  favorites
by drag-and-drop. You can also right click on a favorite or a category
to delete it, export, etc.




<subhead id="zidv" intoc="false">Data in Bundles</subhead>

The IDV  supports a  bundle format: .zidv (or zipped idv).
This is a zip file that contains a regular bundle (xidv) and a set 
of data files. When the user does a &quot;Save As...&quot; and specifies
a .zidv file extension the IDV prompts the user to select the data sources
that should be written into the zip file. On opening a zidv file
the IDV needs to unzip the data files so it prompts the user 
as to where to place the files - a tmp directory or a user selected
directory (this is a preference as well).
<p>
This doesn't seem like such a big deal in and of itself but...
We also have implemented a &quot;Make Remote Data Local&quot; facility.
We can now, for most of the remote data types, move the data
from the server to the local disk. We support the ADDE types: satellite, 
radar, point, sounding and forecast fronts. We also have preliminary
support for grids on remote servers (see below).
<p>
This is used in two ways. First, the user can right click on
a data source in the Field Selector and select &quot;Make Data Local&quot; 
for remote data sources. The IDV prompts for a file directory
and a file prefix (we default to use the name of the data source).
The remote data is then copied over. For multiple files we use:
&lt;directory&gt;&lt;prefix&gt;&lt;file count&gt;.&lt;suffix&gt;. The data source object
within the IDV is then changed to point to the new file paths.
<p>
The second way this is used is when you save off a zidv file.
The user is prompted for both the local data sources to be saved
off as well as for the remote data sources. For the remote ones
the IDV automatically copies the files over  and zips them up.
<p>
Grids: We have preliminary support for grids. This relies on some
extra service information in the catalogs which, right at this moment,
is not included in the regular IDV gridded data catalog but is included
for model data under the &quot;File_Access&quot; dataset in the main motherlode
catalog:
http://motherlode.ucar.edu:8080/thredds/catalog.xml
<p>
When saving gridded data the user is prompted for the fields to save
and the geo-spatial subset is used to subset the grids. We do not
yet (though will soon) support sub-setting on times and grid 
stride/decimation.
