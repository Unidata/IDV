<div class="overview">
Building Collaborative Networks with the IDV and RAMADDA
</div>

<p>The IDV coupled with RAMADDA creates a powerful combination for collaborating on IDV projects with your colleagues. In this exercise, we will build an IDV/RAMADDA collaborative network.</p>

<ol class="step">
<li>Login to your local RAMADDA with the admin account <a href="admin.html">you created earlier</a>, and create a second user named "Jane" with the same password.  Be sure to select a Home Folder, as you did last time. This will be the login for other workshop participants to login to your instance of RAMADDA.</li>

<div class="cimg"><img src="images/usercreate2.gif" ></div>

<li>Please logout of your admin account.</li>

<div class="cimg"><img src="images/logout.gif" ></div>

<li>In the IDV, <a href="idvpub.html">as we did in the previous exercise</a> connect to another workshop participant's instance of RAMADDA with the Jane login. Your instructor will provide you with the host information.</li>

<div class="cimg"><img src="images/plugconfig2.gif" ></div>

<li>Load some data (for example, a sample bundle [ht::menu Displays {Favorite Bundle} Sample {Grid Displays}]) and save this bundle to your folder RAMADDA <a href="idvpub.html">as we did in the previous exercise</a>.</li>
<div class="cimg"><img src="images/ramaddasave2.gif" ></div>

<li>Now save this bundle to your neighbors RAMADDA instance</li>
<div class="cimg"><img src="images/ramaddasave3.gif" ></div>


<li>In the IDV Dashboard, select the "Data Choosers" tab, "Catalogs". In the "Catalogs" text area, enter the URL of the THREDDS catalog: <code>http://localhost:8080/repository?output=thredds.catalog</code>.</li>
<div class="cimg"><img src="images/catalog.gif" ></div>
<li>In the same "Catalogs" text area, enter the URL of another workshop participant. Your instructor will provide you with that URL.</li>
<li>Browse and load each others bundles.</li>

</ol>

<p>You have now built an IDV collaborative network, using RAMADDA. You can publish your work to your peers, as well as browse your  colleague's IDV content.</p>
