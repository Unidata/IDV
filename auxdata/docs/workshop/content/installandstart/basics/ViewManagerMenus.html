<div class="overview">
In addition to the main menu bar, each <code class="dialog">
View Window</code> has another menu with options for controlling
just that view.  In this section, we will explore some of the features of the
<code class="menu">View</code> and <code class="menu">Projections</code>
menus associated with each <code class="dialog">View Window</code>.
</div>

<div class="pagesubtitle">The View Menu</div>

Each <code class="dialog">View Window</code> also has a <b>View</b>
menu that lets you change the point of view, capture the state of
the display, and make other changes in the overall view.

<div class="cimg"><img src="images/ViewMenu.gif" ></div>


First let's look at the Properties dialog for the View Window:

<ol class="step">
 
  <li>Open the [ht::dialog View Window Properties] dialog with the
      [ht::menu View Properties] menu.

      [ht::cimg images/ViewManagerProperties.gif]

  <li>Uncheck the [ht::command {Show Wireframe Box}] item 
      to turn off the 3D box in the display then click the
      [ht::button Apply] button.  Check it
      again to turn the box back on and click the
      [ht::button Apply] button.</li>

  <li>Uncheck the [ht::command {Show Cursor Readout}] item 
      to turn off the lat/lon/alt readout at the bottom of the
      <code class="dialog">View Window</code> and click the 
      [ht::button Apply] button.</li>

  <li>Uncheck the [ht::command {Clip View At Box}] menu item 
      to turn off clipping of the map lines and other displays at
      the 3D box and click [ht::button Apply]. Check it again to 
      turn on clipping.</li>

  <li>Check the [ht::command {Show Times In Display}] item 
      to turn on the time label in the view window.  Uncheck
      the [ht::command {Show Display List}] item and
      click [ht::button Apply]. The Display List is no longer
      shown, but the time label is now shown.  Note that the
      time is also shown as part of the Display List for each
      of the displays and in the [ht::command Time Animation Widget].
  </li>

  <li>Change the foreground and background colors by clicking
      the [ht::button Set] buttons and selecting a new color.
      After making your selection, click [ht::button Apply].

</ol>

The default settings for each of these can be set through the
User Preferences which will be covered later in the workshop.
<p>

<a name="other"></a>
<div class="pagesubtitle">Other View Menus</div>

Some of the properties that we just changed can also be set through 
other [ht::menu View] menus.

<ol>

    <li>Select the [ht::menu View Show] menu to see which of
        the items we changed above are available.  Use some
        of these to change your display.</li>

    <li> Select the [ht::menu View Color] menu to change the
      foreground and background colors of the display.  You 
      can select one of the pre-defined foreground/background
      color pairs, or create your own.  Select one of the 
      predefined options to change the display colors.  Select
      [ht::menu View Color {White on black}] menu to return to
      the system default.</li>

    <li> Select the [ht::menu View {Full Screen}] menu to expand
    the view to the full screen.  Click the X to return to normal
    screen mode.</li>
    
</ol>

<a name="viewpoint"></a>
<div class="pagesubtitle">The View-&gt;Viewpoint Menu</div>

<p>
Another useful menu item is the <code class="menu">Viewpoint</code> menu.  
This menu can be used to control which side of the 3D box you are looking at.  

<div class="cimg"><img src="images/ViewPointMenu.gif" ></div>

<ol class="step">

  <li>The five top menu items, <code class="menu">Top</code> 
      through <code class="menu">West</code> instantly reset the 
      point of view to one of the orthogonal directions.  The menu 
      icons show which side of the box will be displayed.  Note that 
      <code class="menu">Top</code> is the same as the reset 
      command <b>Ctrl-r</b> which we used earlier.  </li>
      
   <li>Select the <code class="menu">South</code> menu then
       rotate the box with the keyboard or mouse to see the orientation.</li>

   <li>Reset the view to the top.</li>

   <li>The <code class="menu">Perspective View</code> item toggles
       between a parallel (unchecked) and perspective (checked)
       view.  Check the box and see what effect it has.</li>

   <li>The <code class="command">Viewpoint toolbar</code>:

<div class="cimg"><img src="images/ViewpointToolbar.gif" ></div>

       provides the same functionality as the menu items described
       above.

</ol>

<p><b>Other Viewpoint menu items</b>

<p><b>Viewpoint Dialog...</b> displays a dialog box for you to enter the 
azimuth and tilt of a desired point of view. 

<p><b>Vertical Scale...</b>displays a dialog box to set the linear vertical
scaling between the top and bottom the wireframe box.  The default
is 0 to 16 km.  This can also be changed through the 
[ht::command Vertical Scale] tab of the [ht::dialog View Window Properties]
dialog.

<a NAME="projections">
<div class="pagesubtitle">The Projections Menu</div>

The <code class="dialog">View Window</code>'s [ht::menu Projections] menu 
let you change and define the map projection.

<div class="cimg"><img src="images/ProjectionsMenu.gif" ></div>


<div><b>Changing Map Projections</b></div>

<p>Map projections define the region of the earth that you are viewing.
The IDV is configured with a set of pre-defined map projections.
In a later exercise, you will learn how to create your own.  In
this exercise, we will learn how to change projections using the
system set.

<div class="cimg"><img src="images/MapsProjections.gif" ></div>

<ol class="step">

  <li>Select the [ht::menu Projections Predefined US CONUS] menu item
      to switch to the continental US projection.</li>

  <li>Choose another projection from the 
      [ht::menu Maps Projections Predefined] menu</li>

</ol>

<p>The [ht::menu Projections {From Displays}] menu has a list of projections
from the data of any displays.  </p>

<p>The [ht::menu Projections History] menu has a list of recently
used projections.  </p>

<p>The [ht::menu Projections {New/Edit..}] menu item is used
to bring up the <code class="dialog">Projection Manager</code>
which is used to define projections.  You will use this in a 
later exercise to define your own projections.</p>

<p>

<b>Other Projections Menu Items</b>

<ul class="step">

  <li>The [ht::menu {Auto-set Projection}] menu
  item allows you to control whether the display projection is changed
  when you load in new data.</li>

  <li>The [ht::menu {Share Views}] menu item allows you to share
      the maps and projections between different
      <code class="dialog">View Windows</code>.

    <ol class="substep">

      <li>Select the [ht::menu File New {View Window} {Map Display} {One Pane}] menu item
          to bring up a new <code class="dialog">View Window</code>.</li>

      <li>Rotate the view in each display.

      <li>Use the [ht::menu Projections Set] menu in each
          <code class="dialog">View Window</code> to change the
          projections to be different in each display.</li>

      <li>Check the [ht::menu Projections {Share Views}] item in 
          each <code class="dialog">View Window</code>.</li>

      <li>Rotate the view in one display.  Notice how it affects
          the other.</li>

      <li>Change the projection in one of the displays.  The same projection
          will be applied to the other display.</li>

      <li>Close the second <code class="dialog">View Window</code>
          by clicking the <b>X</b> in the upper right corner of the
          window.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>

</ul>
